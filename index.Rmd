# Before we start{-}

**What is the purpose of my research?** <br>
This study aims to investigate the exposure to air pollution in Seoul and the following health effects and suggest possible solutions using agent-based modelling (ABM).


**Why am I writing this document?** <br>
I am writing this document because all the data that I retrieved were `free-to-use`, and more importantly I wanted to share the journey of starting from scratch to the final production.


**Further Enquiries** <br>
If you have any enquiries regarding the data or the results, please contact me via github(`@mrsensible`), twitter(`@hyesop`), or email(hyesop.shin@glasgow.ac.uk).
