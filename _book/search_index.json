This chapter examined how non-exhaust PM10 generated by tyres and brakes can cumulatively trigger health decline to business commuters at Seoul CBD. This study looks at how different travel patterns associate with PM10 exposure and health decline: local residents travelling with cars vs long-distance commuters taking subways. Compared to the previous study that investigated 12 years at a 12 hour step, this chapter works on a shorter time period and a minute step, focusing more on the effect of instantaneous exposure to PM10. To achieve the aim, this study applies models such as vehicle mobility, human mobility, exposure and health loss equation, and scenario forecasting. 4.1 Data list Air Pollution Traffic Count Origin-Destination Matrix 4.1.1 Air Pollution Hourly measured PM10 was used from an urban background station, Jongno, and a kerbside station Jongno4. The study period was set between January-March 2018, as the mortality rate attributed to high air pollution exposure was observed during winter. 4.1.2 Traffic Count According to the 2018 AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic) statistics published by KTDB(Korean Transport Database), I got various plots that I can calibrate with. The raw data comes from the KTDB survey, where they measure the Origins and Destinations. To clean the data ready for the CBD area, I filtered passenger car counts and the destination sub-districts to include CBD areas. The first figure shows the total car estimation by hours. The pink and blue line represents the inflow and outflow. You can see that the inflow rises from 5:00am, peaks at 8am, and gradually decreases thereafter. The barplots below is a reference that show the weekly and monthly flow in 2018. 4.1.3 Origin-Destination Matrix This study used the mode-based origin-destination (OD) matrix from the Korean Transport database (KTDB). KTDB provides 15 modes that include walking, passenger car, carpooled people, city bus, regional bus, town bus, intercity bus, express bus, other buses, subway, rail, speed rail, taxi, small freight, large freight, motorbike, bicycle, and others. The 2015 database provides three type of OD matrix based on weekdays, which are morning rush hours (07-09 hours), evening rush hours (18-20 hours), and a daily aggregate. The database also estimates passengers per vehicle type and distance by regions. Seoul allocated 1.42 persons for inbound passenger cars travelling and 1.33 persons for outbound; each taxi has 1.47 persons; each city bus has 19.27 persons, intercity bus with 13.48 persons, and regional bus with 19.02 persons. Each row gives an origin and destination areas based on the admin codes and all the modes as an approximated number. For example, passenger cars from Sajik to Sajik will have 539.008 persons travelling per day. 4.2 What the data looks like: Exploration with R 4.3 Output: Univeral Kriging 4.4 Output: Generalised Additive Models 4.5 Summary "]
