This study aims to investigate the exposure to air pollution in Seoul and the following health effects and suggest possible solutions using agent-based modelling (ABM). Why am I writing this document? I am writing this document because all the data that I retrieved were free-to-use, and more importantly I wanted to share the journey of starting from scratch to the final production.

This chapter initially argues that the comparison amongst methods should not merely conclude with error measurements but should add more information on the difference; secondly argues that finer temporal scale is needed in pollution studies due to human mobility and daily and seasonal dynamics of pollution. Hence, this chapter aims to compare spatial interpolation methods that can support population exposure to daily air pollution. Seoul was selected as a case study. This chapter firstly explores the pollution data in different time sequences and types of monitoring stations. Then it compares two spatial interpolation methods, Universal Kriging, GAM, with additional weights on road layers as an effect of roadside pollution fields. After the calibration and validation, this chapter finally discusses issues relevant to interpolation methods and health effects. 2.1 Data list 2.2 What the data looks like: Exploration with R 2.3 Output: Univeral Kriging 2.4 Output: Generalised Additive Models 2.5 Summary "],["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods", " Chapter 3 Methods We describe our methods in this chapter.

This chapter examined how non-exhaust PM10 generated by tyres and brakes can cumulatively trigger health decline to business commuters at Seoul CBD. This study looks at how different travel patterns associate with PM10 exposure and health decline: local residents travelling with cars vs long-distance commuters taking subways. Compared to the previous study that investigated 12 years at a 12 hour step, this chapter works on a shorter time period and a minute step, focusing more on the effect of instantaneous exposure to PM10. To achieve the aim, this study applies models such as vehicle mobility, human mobility, exposure and health loss equation, and scenario forecasting. 4.1 Data list Air Pollution Traffic Count Origin-Destination Matrix 4.1.1 Air Pollution Hourly measured PM10 was used from an urban background station, Jongno, and a kerbside station Jongno4. The study period was set between January-March 2018, because ambient pollutant levels during winter tend to be higher compared to the rest of the year due to stable atmospheric conditions and more generation of domestic heat (Guram et al., 2019). 4.1.2 Traffic Count According to the 2018 AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic) statistics published by KTDB(Korean Transport Database), I got various plots that I can calibrate with. The raw data comes from the KTDB survey, where they measure the Origins and Destinations. To clean the data ready for the CBD area, I filtered passenger car counts and the destination sub-districts to include CBD areas. The first figure shows the total car estimation by hours. The pink and blue line represents the inflow and outflow. You can see that the inflow rises from 5:00am, peaks at 8am, and gradually decreases thereafter. The barplots below is a reference that show the weekly and monthly flow in 2018. 4.1.3 Origin-Destination Matrix This study used the mode-based origin-destination (OD) matrix from the Korean Transport database (KTDB). KTDB provides 15 modes that include walking, passenger car, carpooled people, city bus, regional bus, town bus, intercity bus, express bus, other buses, subway, rail, speed rail, taxi, small freight, large freight, motorbike, bicycle, and others. The 2015 database provides three type of OD matrix based on weekdays, which are morning rush hours (07-09 hours), evening rush hours (18-20 hours), and a daily aggregate. The database also estimates passengers per vehicle type and distance by regions. Seoul allocated 1.42 persons for inbound passenger cars travelling and 1.33 persons for outbound; each taxi has 1.47 persons; each city bus has 19.27 persons, intercity bus with 13.48 persons, and regional bus with 19.02 persons. Each row gives an origin and destination areas based on the admin codes and all the modes as an approximated number. For example, passenger cars from Sajik to Sajik will have 539.008 persons travelling per day. 4.2 What the data looks like: Exploration with R 4.3 Output: Univeral Kriging 4.4 Output: Generalised Additive Models 4.5 Summary "],["final-words.html", "Chapter 5 Final Words", " Chapter 5 Final Words We have finished a nice book.
