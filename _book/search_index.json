This chapter initially argues that the comparison amongst methods should not merely conclude with error measurements but should add more information on the difference; secondly argues that finer temporal scale is needed in pollution studies due to human mobility and daily and seasonal dynamics of pollution. Hence, this chapter aims to compare spatial interpolation methods that can support population exposure to daily air pollution. Seoul was selected as a case study. This chapter firstly explores the pollution data in different time sequences and types of monitoring stations. Then it compares two spatial interpolation methods, Universal Kriging, GAM, with additional weights on road layers as an effect of roadside pollution fields. After the calibration and validation, this chapter finally discusses issues relevant to interpolation methods and health effects. 2.1 Data list 2.2 What the data looks like: Exploration with R 2.3 Output: Univeral Kriging 2.4 Output: Generalised Additive Models 2.5 Summary "],

This chapter examined the cumulative exposure to non-exhuast PM of subway commuters and resident drivers to see whether traffic-related particles negatively contribute to the air quality and human health. Compared to the previous study, this chapter demonstrates pollution and individual mobility at a finer scale, investigating health decline associated with instantaneous PM10. This study applies vehicle mobility, human mobility, exposure and health loss 4.1 Data list 4.1.1 Air Pollution Hourly measured PM10 was used from an urban background station, Jongno, and a kerbside station Jongno4. The study period was set between January-March 2018, as it is frequent to observe the severity of health effects attributed to high air pollution exposure. Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualisation were done under the tidyverse package in R 4.0.0. 4.1.2 Annual Traffic Count KTDB 4.1.3 Origin-Destination Matrix This study used the mode-based origin-destination (OD) matrix from the Korean Transport database (KTDB). KTDB provides 15 modes that include walking, passenger car, carpooled people, city bus, regional bus, town bus, intercity bus, express bus, other buses, subway, rail, speed rail, taxi, small freight, large freight, motorbike, bicycle, and others. The 2015 database provides three type of OD matrix based on weekdays, which are morning rush hours (07-09 hours), evening rush hours (18-20 hours), and a daily aggregate. The database also estimates passengers per vehicle type and distance by regions. Seoul allocated 1.42 persons for inbound passenger cars travelling and 1.33 persons for outbound; each taxi has 1.47 persons; each city bus has 19.27 persons, intercity bus with 13.48 persons, and regional bus with 19.02 persons. Each row gives an origin and destination areas based on the admin codes and all the modes as an approximated number. For example, passenger cars from Sajik to Sajik will have 539.008 persons travelling per day. 4.2 What the data looks like: Exploration with R 4.3 Output: Univeral Kriging 4.4 Output: Generalised Additive Models 4.5 Summary "],
