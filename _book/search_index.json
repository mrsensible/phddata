This chapter initially argues that the comparison amongst methods should not merely conclude with error measurements but should add more information on the difference; secondly argues that finer temporal scale is needed in pollution studies due to human mobility and daily and seasonal dynamics of pollution. Hence, this chapter aims to compare spatial interpolation methods that can support population exposure to daily air pollution. Seoul was selected as a case study. This chapter firstly explores the pollution data in different time sequences and types of monitoring stations. Then it compares two spatial interpolation methods, Universal Kriging, GAM, with additional weights on road layers as an effect of roadside pollution fields. After the calibration and validation, this chapter finally discusses issues relevant to interpolation methods and health effects. 2.1 Data list 2.2 What the data looks like: Exploration with R 2.3 Output: Univeral Kriging 2.4 Output: Generalised Additive Models 2.5 Summary "]
