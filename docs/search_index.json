Until recently, tracking individuals for a continuous amount of time was almost impossible, and even where it is now possible, one may run into problems with devices needing continuous power. Even if individual tracking can be monitored, it may take around 30 years to get a meaningful causation between exposure and health outcomes over a large segment of the population, with diverse individual characteristics. Without individual measuring devices, the interpolated pollution fields with sparse fixed-site monitors cannot be meaningfully interpolated down to the individual scale. Another problem of large and smoothed interpolation is that it might ignore the spatial and temporal peaks of pollution that might be vital to health outcomes (see Figure 1.1 as an example). Consequently, there remains a mismatch between the large scale of interpolated mapping analysis and the individuals being exposed to air pollution from their activity patterns. Figure 1.1: Estimated 2013 annual average of PM2.5 in the troposphere as detected by the grid cell average of satellite-based estimates from the TM5-FASST simulation. (imported from Brauer et al. (2016)) 1.2 Purpose The overall purpose of this study is to estimate how health vulnerability from an unequal distribution of individuals can be affected by air pollution in the case of Seoul, South Korea. These results will provide new insights for suggesting a reduction policy for the population’s future exposure. Research Questions How can vulnerability to air pollution be conceptualised to take in the full account of exposure and sensitivity? What do spatial and temporal trends of pollution reveal about its distribution and how can the methods be used to estimate pollution on a large urban space? How does the response pattern from pollution vary between population groups and how does it appear on the geographical landscape after applying an agent-based model? What do GIS and agent-based modelling scenarios suggest for the case-study city about future patterns of risk and the need for interventions, e.g. in terms of protection and support? 1.3 Study Area Chapter 3: Seoul and adjacent cities Chapter 4: Seoul by districts Chapter 5: Seoul CBD (Central Business District) Figure 1.2: Basemap (A) and Topography (B) of Seoul References "],["lit-review.html", "Chapter 2 Literature Review 2.1 Pollutants 2.2 Exposure Studies: Models 2.3 Agent-based models", " Chapter 2 Literature Review 2.1 Pollutants In Chapter 2, I have looked though different types of pollutants that can harm human health. Chapter 2 chose PM10 and NO2 for the empirical chapters. Chapter 2 contextualised the association between pollution, exposure, and health risk, and how sensitivity and adaptation can change the patterns of exposure. 2.2 Exposure Studies: Models Exposure studies are categorised into population exposure and individual exposure. And this normally is tied with the method used. Chapter 2 reviewed spatial interpolation and dispersion models, and criticised that using a static population does not fully account for the temporal variability that individuals might experience; using spatially poor station levels too does not consider the small-scale variability that can happen in the real world. Activity Patterns and Exposure OD matrices have filled the gaps of activity patterns to some extent but have not been able to consider the routes to which the individuals take every day. Mobile phone data cannot trace individual data due to privacy issues, and the representation of users strongly depends on the mobile company within the country. Low-cost sensors and GPS signals have shown minute based trajectories and pollution levels at human height However, these have shortness of battery problems and a number of participants to test different routes. 2.3 Agent-based models ABMs can be an alternative to the above methods as they can evaluate population exposure for all heterogeneous agents, conduct short or long-term simulation studies that can take up to a decade, assign cognitive decisions for an individual’s pathfinding, and experiment with scenarios that might happen in the future. However, this too is a model that takes into account many assumptions, and constructing an ABM taking into account all the individual attributes takes a long time until completion (approximately two years). With huge output files, it might also need to be subsetted and restructured to produce the results with the computer memory secured. Published studies of Sydney (Dons et al. 2014) have introduced a pollution dispersion model and a dose-response model to estimate the health risk of air pollution. Using a static population and a coarse resolution oversimplified the result. A more recent study in Tampa (Gurram, Stuart, and Pinjari 2019) used a microscopic simulation method that considered traffic, pollution and population activity to assess the uneven distribution of NO2 exposure across the city. However, the execution period was too short (one day) to determine the effect of socioeconomic factors.

Then it compares two spatial interpolation methods, Universal Kriging, GAM, with additional weights on road layers as an effect of roadside pollution fields. After the calibration and validation, this chapter finally discusses issues relevant to interpolation methods and health effects. 3.1 Data list 3.1.1 Pollution Components Variables References Exposure PM10 National Institute of Environmental Research Exposure NO2 National Institute of Environmental Research Road Weight Road Layer Korean Transport Database (KTDB) Pollution This study selected PM10 as the main source that can causally result in human cancer and NO2 as the main source that harms respiratory symptoms, whether constantly or instantaneously (Europe 2013). 57 background stations (installed on the rooftops of district offices) 19 roadside stations (close to the major roads which are strongly affected by nearby traffic) (see Figure 3.1). Download period: 01/01/2010 01:00 and 01/01/2018 00:00 Units: in ppb (parts per billion) for NO2, and µg/m3 for PM10. Figure 3.1: Background pollution stations that are considered for spatial interpolation (boundary area: Seoul) Road Layer Seoul had 59,319 road segments in total, The attributes of each segment included node ID, link ID, number of lanes, maximum speed, traffic light density, and road ranks Road segments were grouped by their road ranks as a level to distinguish different pollution loading. Rural and county roads 105, 106, and 107 were excluded due to a small fraction existing in Seoul. The roads were regrouped as general roads (103, 104), and highways (101, 102, 108) to distinguish the pollution loads by two road types.

This chapter examined how non-exhaust PM10 generated by tyres and brakes can cumulatively trigger health decline to business commuters at Seoul CBD. This study looks at how different travel patterns associate with PM10 exposure and health decline: local residents travelling with cars vs long-distance commuters taking subways. Compared to the previous study that investigated 12 years at a 12 hour step, this chapter works on a shorter time period and a minute step, focusing more on the effect of instantaneous exposure to PM10. To achieve the aim, this study applies models such as vehicle mobility, human mobility, exposure and health loss equation, and scenario forecasting. 5.1 Data list Air Pollution Traffic Count Origin-Destination Matrix 5.1.1 Air Pollution Hourly measured PM10 was used from an urban background station, Jongno, and a kerbside station Jongno4. The study period was set between January-March 2018, because ambient pollutant levels during winter tend to be higher compared to the rest of the year due to stable atmospheric conditions and more generation of domestic heat (Guram et al., 2019). 5.1.2 Traffic Count According to the 2018 AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic) statistics published by KTDB(Korean Transport Database), I got various plots that I can calibrate with. The raw data comes from the KTDB survey, where they measure the Origins and Destinations. To clean the data ready for the CBD area, I filtered passenger car counts and the destination sub-districts to include CBD areas. The first figure shows the total car estimation by hours. The pink and blue line represents the inflow and outflow. You can see that the inflow rises from 5:00am, peaks at 8am, and gradually decreases thereafter. The barplots below is a reference that show the weekly and monthly flow in 2018. 5.1.3 Origin-Destination Matrix This study used the mode-based origin-destination (OD) matrix from the Korean Transport database (KTDB). KTDB provides 15 modes that include walking, passenger car, carpooled people, city bus, regional bus, town bus, intercity bus, express bus, other buses, subway, rail, speed rail, taxi, small freight, large freight, motorbike, bicycle, and others. The 2015 database provides three type of OD matrix based on weekdays, which are morning rush hours (07-09 hours), evening rush hours (18-20 hours), and a daily aggregate. The database also estimates passengers per vehicle type and distance by regions. Seoul allocated 1.42 persons for inbound passenger cars travelling and 1.33 persons for outbound; each taxi has 1.47 persons; each city bus has 19.27 persons, intercity bus with 13.48 persons, and regional bus with 19.02 persons. Each row gives an origin and destination areas based on the admin codes and all the modes as an approximated number. For example, passenger cars from Sajik to Sajik will have 539.008 persons travelling per day. 5.2 What the data looks like: Exploration with R 5.3 Output: Univeral Kriging 5.4 Output: Generalised Additive Models 5.5 Summary "],["final-words.html", "Chapter 6 Final Words", " Chapter 6 Final Words We have finished a nice book.
