abstract = {Background
Studies on air pollution and depression in the elderly are limited and the results are heterogeneous.
Objectives
We examined the association of ambient air pollution exposure and diagnosis and symptoms of depression in the elderly; and whether any associations were confounded or modified by cognitive decline.
Methods
We enrolled 821 elderly women from the German SALIA cohort (follow-up examination, 2007–2010). Self-reported depressive symptoms and level of cognition were evaluated using the CESD-R Scale and the CERAD-Plus test, respectively. We used two depression endpoints for analyses: self-reported doctor diagnosis of depression and frequency of depressive symptoms (CESD-R score). Long-term concentrations of particulate matter (PM) size fractions and nitrogen oxides (NOx) modeled by land-use regression were assigned to home addresses. Cross-sectional associations were assessed using adjusted logistic and linear regression models.
Results
Concentrations of coarse particles (PMcoarse), fine particles (PM2.5 and PM2.5 abs) and NO2 were significantly associated with diagnosis of depression (e.g. for PM2.5 OR = 1.62, 95{\%}CI: 1.06, 2.46 and for NO2 OR = 1.54, 95{\%} CI: 1.08, 2.19). Similarly, an increase of one interquartile range in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and NOx was associated with depressive symptoms assessed with the CESD-R score (e.g. for PM2.5 16.2{\%} difference in the mean; 95{\%} CI: 5.8{\%}, 26.5{\%} and for NO2 14.5{\%}; 95{\%} CI: 4.8{\%}, 24.2{\%}). These associations were stronger in women with cognitive decline (e.g. Pint for PM2.5:0.022 and NO2:0.017) compared to women with normal cognition. In addition, living less than 100 m distance to major roads was significantly associated with diagnosis (OR = 1.99, 95{\%} CI: 1.14, 3.47) and symptoms (19.7{\%}; 95{\%} CI: 4.3{\%}, 35.1{\%}) of depression. We did not observe any interaction effect of cognition on prior diagnosis of depression.
Conclusions
Exposure to air pollution was associated with diagnosis of depression and depressive symptoms in elderly women. Women with impaired cognition may be at greater risk of depressive symptoms when exposed to air pollution.},

abstract = {Road dust resuspension has a significant contribution to the atmospheric particulate matter levels in urban areas, but loadings, emission factors, and chemical source profiles vary geographically, hampering the accuracy of emission inventories and source contribution estimates. Given the dearth of studies on the variability of road dust, in the present study, an in-situ resuspension chamber was used to collect PM10 samples from seven representative streets in Viana do Castelo, the northernmost coastal city in Portugal. PM10 samples were analysed for organic and elemental carbon by a thermo-optical technique, elemental composition by ICP-MS and ICP-AES, and organic constituents by GC–MS. Emission factors were estimated to be, on average, 340 and 41.2 mg veh−1 km−1 for cobbled and asphalt pavements, respectively. Organic carbon accounted for 5.56 ± 1.24{\%} of the PM10 mass. Very low concentrations of PAHs and their alkylated congeners were detected, denoting a slight predominance of petrogenic compounds. Si, Al, Fe, Ca and K were the most abundant elements. The calculation of various geochemical indices (enrichment factor, geoaccumulation index, pollution index and potential ecological risk) showed that road dust was extremely enriched and contaminated by elements from tyre and brake wear (e.g. Sb, Sn, Cu, Bi and Zn), while lithophile elements showed no enrichment. For As, the geochemical and pollution indices reached their maximum in the street most influenced by agricultural activities. Sb, Cd, Cu and As can pose a very high ecological risk. Sb can be regarded as the pollutant of highest concern, since it represented 57{\%} of the total ecological risk. Hazard indices higher than 1 for some anthropogenic elements indicate that non-carcinogenic effects may occur. Except for a street with more severe braking, the total carcinogenic risks can be considered insignificant.},

abstract = {About 400,000 premature adult deaths attributable to air pollution occur each year in the European Region. Road transport emissions account for a significant share of this burden. While important technological improvements have been made for reducing particulate matter (PM) emissions from motor exhausts, no actions are currently in place to reduce the non-exhaust part of emissions such as those from brake wear, road wear, tyre wear and road dust resuspension. These "non-exhaust" sources contribute easily as much and often more than the tailpipe exhaust to the ambient air PM concentrations in cities, and their relative contribution to ambient PM is destined to increase in the future, posing obvious research and policy challenges.This review highlights the major and more recent research findings in four complementary fields of research and seeks to identify the current gaps in research and policy with regard to non-exhaust emissions. The objective of this article is to encourage and direct future research towards an improved understanding on the relationship between emissions, concentrations, exposure and health impact and on the effectiveness of potential remediation measures in the urban environment. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Purpose– Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) has seen wide-spread success through its applications in the sciences and social sciences over the last 15 years. As ABMS is used to model more and more complex systems, there is going to be an increase in the number of input variables used within the simulation. Any uncertainty associated with these input variables can be investigated using sensitivity analysis, but when there is uncertainty surrounding several of these input variables, a single parameter sensitivity analysis is not adequate. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) offers a way to sample variations in multiple parameters without having to consider all of the possible permutations. This paper introduces the application of LHS to ABMS via a case study that investigates the mortgage foreclosure contagion effect. This paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach– Traditionally, uncertainty surrounding a single input variable is investigated using sensitivity analysis. That is, the variable is allowed to change to determine the impact of this variation on the simulation's output. When there is uncertainty about multiple input variables, then the number of simulation runs required to undertake this investigation greatly increases due to the permutations that need to be considered. LHS, which was first derived by McKay et al., offers a proven mechanism to reduce the number of simulation runs needed to complete a sensitivity analysis. This paper describes the LHS technique and its applications to an agent-based simulation (ABS) for investigating the foreclosure contagion effect. Findings– The results from the foreclosure ABS runs have been characterized as “good”, “bad” or “ugly”, corresponding to whether or not a property market crash has occurred. As the only thing that can induce a property market crash within our model is the spread of foreclosing properties, these results indicate that the foreclosure contagion effect is dependent on how much impact a foreclosed property has on the price of the surrounding properties. Originality/value– This paper describes the application of LHS to an agent-based foreclosure simulation. The foreclosure model and its results have been described in Gangel et al. Given a certain output “boundary” found within these results, it was highly appropriate to conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis on the simulation's input variables. The outcome of the LHS sensitivity analysis has given further insight into the foreclosure contagion effect thus demonstrating it was a beneficial exercise.},

abstract = {The city of London, UK, has seen in recent years an increase in the number of high-rise/multi-storey buildings (“skyscrapers”) with roof heights reaching 150 m and more, with the Shard being a prime example with a height of ∼310 m. This changing cityscape together with recent plans of local authorities of introducing Combined Heat and Power Plant (CHP) led to a detailed study in which CFD and wind tunnel studies were carried out to assess the effect of such high-rise buildings on the dispersion of air pollution in their vicinity. A new, open-source simulator, FLUIDITY, which incorporates the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method, was implemented; the simulated results were subsequently validated against experimental measurements from the EnFlo wind tunnel. The novelty of the LES methodology within FLUIDITY is based on the combination of an adaptive, unstructured, mesh with an eddy-viscosity tensor (for the sub-grid scales) that is anisotropic. The simulated normalised mean concentrations results were compared to the corresponding wind tunnel measurements, showing for most detector locations good correlations, with differences ranging from 3{\%} to 37{\%}. The validation procedure was followed by the simulation of two further hypothetical scenarios, in which the heights of buildings surrounding the source building were increased. The results showed clearly how the high-rise buildings affected the surrounding air flows and dispersion patterns, with the generation of “dead-zones” and high-concentration “hotspots” in areas where these did not previously exist. The work clearly showed that complex CFD modelling can provide useful information to urban planners when changes to cityscapes are considered, so that design options can be tested against environmental quality criteria.},

We assembled a database of {\textgreater}100 daily, measured and modelled pollutant concentrations characterizing air pollution in London between 2011 and 2012. Based on the analyses of temporal patterns and correlations between the metrics, knowledge of local emission sources and reference to the existing literature, we selected, a priori, markers of traffic pollution: oxides of nitrogen (general traffic); elemental and black carbon (EC/BC) (diesel exhaust); carbon monoxide (petrol exhaust); copper (tyre), zinc (brake) and aluminium (mineral dust). Poisson regression accounting for seasonality and meteorology was used to estimate the percentage change in risk of death associated with an interquartile increment of each pollutant. Associations were generally small with confidence intervals that spanned 0{\%} and tended to be negative for cardiovascular mortality and positive for respiratory mortality. The strongest positive associations were for EC and BC adjusted for particle mass and respiratory mortality, 2.66{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.11, 5.28) and 2.72{\%} (0.09, 5.42) per 0.8 and 1.0 $\mu$g/m 3, respectively. These associations were robust to adjustment for other traffic metrics and regional pollutants, suggesting a degree of specificity with respiratory mortality and diesel exhaust containing EC/BC.},

abstract = {A major focus of recent work on the spatial patterning of health has been the study of how features of residential environments or neighborhoods may affect health. Place effects on health emerge from complex interdependent processes in which individuals interact with each other and their environment and in which both individuals and environments adapt and change over time. Traditional epidemiologic study designs and statistical regression approaches are unable to examine these dynamic processes. These limitations have constrained the types of questions asked, the answers received, and the hypotheses and theoretical explanations that are developed. Agent-based models and other systems-dynamics models may help to address some of these challenges. Agent-based models are computer representations of systems consisting of heterogeneous microentities that can interact and change/adapt over time in response to other agents and features of the environment. Using these models, one can observe how macroscale dynamics emerge from microscale interactions and adaptations. A number of challenges and limitations exist for agent-based modeling. Nevertheless, use of these dynamic models may complement traditional epidemiologic analyses and yield additional insights into the processes involved and the interventions that may be most useful.},

abstract = {Many epidemiologic studies of the health effects of exposure to ambient air pollution use measurements from central-site monitors as their exposure estimate. However, measurements from central-site monitors may lack the spatial and temporal resolution required to capture exposure variability in a study population, thus resulting in exposure error and biased estimates. Articles in this dedicated issue examine various approaches to predict or assign exposures to ambient pollutants. These methods include combining existing central-site pollution measurements with local- and/or regional-scale air quality models to create new or "hybrid" models for pollutant exposure estimates and using exposure models to account for factors such as infiltration of pollutants indoors and human activity patterns. Key findings from these articles are summarized to provide lessons learned and recommendations for additional research on improving exposure estimation approaches for future epidemiological studies. In summary, when compared with use of central-site monitoring data, the enhanced spatial resolution of air quality or exposure models can have an impact on resultant health effect estimates, especially for pollutants derived from local sources such as traffic (e.g., EC, CO, and NO(x)). In addition, the optimal exposure estimation approach also depends upon the epidemiological study design. We recommend that future research develops pollutant-specific infiltration data (including for PM species) and improves existing data on human time-activity patterns and exposure to local source (e.g., traffic), in order to enhance human exposure modeling estimates. We also recommend comparing how various approaches to exposure estimation characterize relationships between multiple pollutants in time and space and investigating the impact of improved exposure estimates in chronic health studies.},

abstract = {Background Few studies on long-term exposure to air pollution and mortality have been reported from Europe. Within the multicentre European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), we aimed to investigate the association between natural-cause mortality and long-term exposure to several air pollutants. Methods We used data from 22 European cohort studies, which created a total study population of 367 251 participants. All cohorts were general population samples, although some were restricted to one sex only. With a strictly standardised protocol, we assessed residential exposure to air pollutants as annual average concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with diameters of less than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM 2.5 ), less than 10 $\mu$m (PM 10 ), and between 10 $\mu$m and 2.5 $\mu$m (PM coarse ), PM 2.5 absorbance, and annual average concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO 2 and NO x ) with land use regression models. We also investigated two traffic intensity variables-traffic intensity on the nearest road (vehicles per day) and total traffic load on all major roads within a 100 m buffer. We did cohort-specific statistical analyses using confounder models with increasing adjustment for confounder variables, and Cox proportional hazards models with a common protocol. We obtained pooled effect estimates through a random-effects metaanalysis. Findings The total study population consisted of 367 251 participants who contributed 5 118 039 person-years at risk (average follow-up 13.9 years), of whom 29 076 died from a natural cause during follow-up. A significantly increased hazard ratio (HR) for PM 2.5 of 1.07 (95{\%} CI 1.02-1.13) per 5 $\mu$g/m 3 was recorded. No heterogeneity was noted between individual cohort effect estimates (I 2 p value=0.95).

abstract = {The London household survey has shown that people travel and are exposed to air pollutants differently. This argues for human exposure to be based upon space-time-activity data and spatio-temporal air quality predictions. For the latter, we have demonstrated the role that dispersion models can play by using two complimentary models, KCLurban, which gives source apportionment information, and Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ)-urban, which predicts hourly air quality. The KCLurban model is in close agreement with observations of NO(X), NO(2) and particulate matter (PM)(10/2.5), having a small normalised mean bias (-6{\%} to 4{\%}) and a large Index of Agreement (0.71-0.88). The temporal trends of NO(X) from the CMAQ-urban model are also in reasonable agreement with observations. Spatially, NO(2) predictions show that within 10's of metres of major roads, concentrations can range from approximately 10-20 p.p.b. up to 70 p.p.b. and that for PM(10/2.5) central London roadside concentrations are approximately double the suburban background concentrations. Exposure to different PM sources is important and we predict that brake wear-related PM(10) concentrations are approximately eight times greater near major roads than at suburban background locations. Temporally, we have shown that average NO(X) concentrations close to roads can range by a factor of approximately six between the early morning minimum and morning rush hour maximum periods. These results present strong arguments for the hybrid exposure model under development at King's and, in future, for in-building models and a model for the London Underground.},

abstract = {How one builds, checks, validates and interprets a model depends on its ‘purpose'. This is true even if the same model code is used for different purposes. This means that a model built for one purpose but then used for another needs to be re-justified for the new purpose and this will probably mean it also has to be re-checked, re-validated and maybe even re-built in a different way. Here we review some of the different purposes for a simulation model of complex social phenomena, focusing on seven in particular: prediction, explanation, description, theoretical exploration, illustration, analogy, and social interaction. The paper looks at some of the implications in terms of the ways in which the intended purpose might fail. This analysis motivates some of the ways in which these ‘dangers' might be avoided or mitigated. It also looks at the ways that a confusion of modelling purposes can fatally weaken modelling projects, whilst giving a false sense of their quality. These distinctions clarify some previous debates as to the best modelling strategy (e.g. KISS and KIDS). The paper ends with a plea for modellers to be clear concerning which purpose they are justifying their model against.},

The model is designed to integrate social, economic, environmental, and policy factors . A participatory approach with scientists, farmers and policy makers has been implemented to achieve this goal. This approach combines role playing  games with agent-based modelling.  A set of scenarios are elaborated to evaluate the possible impacts of policy interventions and climate change on agrobiodiversity dynamics. Simulations showed how farmers manage crop varietal diversity to cope with the local climate variability for their annual crop production. The portfolio of varieties increases under stable and good climate condition and decrease under less favourable and variable climate conditions.  In addition, depending on the climate condition, farmers allocate preferentially land to varieties with higher yields.},

Population health studies indicate that wildfire smoke is a risk to human health and increases the healthcare burden of smoke-impacted areas. However, wildfire smoke composition is complex and dynamic, making characterization and modeling difficult. Furthermore, current efforts to study the effect of wildfire smoke are limited by availability of air quality measures and inconsistent air quality reporting among researchers. To help address these issues, we conducted a substantive review of wildfire smoke effects on population health, wildfire smoke exposure in occupational health, and experimental wood smoke exposure. Our goal was to evaluate the current literature on wildfire smoke and highlight important gaps in research. In particular we emphasize long-term health effects of wildfire smoke, recovery following wildfire smoke exposure, and health consequences of exposure in children.},

abstract = {Quantification of the spatial and temporal variations of outdoor air pollutant concentrations provides important information for epidemiological and other air-pollution studies, many of which have relied in the past on data from a single, centrally-located air pollution monitoring site. A method is developed for combining air pollution measurements from multiple monitors and monitoring networks to generate daily air pollution concentration fields representing spatial variations over distances of approximately 1–10 km. Meteorological and co-pollutant data are used to estimate missing site measurements, yielding more realistic concentration fields as the number of monitoring locations with available data increases. Monitoring data are interpolated with weights computed from intersite pollutant correlations, which decay with distance, so distances between interpolation points and monitoring sites are factored into the interpolation weights. The approach minimizes the influence of source-oriented sites that represent limited areas, because data from such sites exhibit low intersite correlations and yield interpolation weights that decay rapidly to zero. Interpolated values represent pollutant concentrations averaged over spatial scales that depend on intersite distances and the interpolation grid, and do not delineate sharp spatial gradients associated with roadside or near-source conditions. The approach yields quantified interpolation errors the values of which depend on measurement uncertainties, intersite distances, and the representativeness of monitoring site locations. The method is illustrated using an 11-year period of measurements of ozone, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations from Jefferson County, Alabama. The principal city is Birmingham, which is influenced by regional-scale air pollution and by local emissions from mobile sources, industrial facilities, and residential communities. Emission sources are not distributed uniformly throughout Birmingham, the ridge-and-valley topography complicates dispersion of local emissions, and monitoring data indicate that air pollutant concentrations vary spatially as well as temporally. No single monitor represents air quality across the entire study area.},

Herein we create an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates longitudinal patterns in human behavior. By basing the ABM upon an artificial intelligence (AI) system, we create agents that mimic human decisions on performing behaviors relevant for determining exposures to chemicals and other stressors. We implement the ABM in a computer program called the Agent-Based Model of Human Activity Patterns (ABMHAP) that predicts the longitudinal patterns for sleeping, eating, commuting, and working. We then show that ABMHAP is capable of simulating behavior over extended periods of time. We propose that this framework, and models based on it, can generate longitudinal human behavior data for use in exposure assessments.},

abstract = {Harmful emissions like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter are one of the big challenges facing modern society. These emissions are especially apparent in agglomerations. Possible solutions to overcome this challenge within the framework of the transformation of the transport sector are the change of the transport vehicles of freight and passenger transport or changing the fuel of the vehicles. Determining the viability of both approaches requires analyses to determine which vehicles are the main polluters in urban areas. This study outlines a bottom-up approach for the calculation of road transport emissions on street level in the representative model region of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, considering eight different vehicle classes as well as diesel and gasoline as fuel. Part of the approach is the development of a street-section traffic volume map considering all streets in the model region using a developed multivariate linear regression model for Germany and existing traffic counts. Using the approach developed here, the urban areas of Herne, Oberhausen and Bochum were identified as hotspots with the highest specific nitrogen oxide emissions, while the urban areas of Herne, Oberhausen and Gelsenkirchen were identified as hotspots with the highest specific particulate matter emissions. A detailed investigation of Oberhausen as a representative emission hotspot showed that 91{\%} of road transport nitrogen oxide emissions are produced by vehicles that use diesel fuel and 9{\%} from vehicles with gasoline fuel, while gasoline vehicles account for 43{\%} of the total distance driven and diesel vehicles for 57{\%}. With respect to particulate matter emissions in the urban area of Oberhausen, 29{\%} are produced by gasoline vehicles and 71{\%} by diesel vehicles. However, only 22{\%} of particulate matter emissions are exhaust emissions, while 78{\%} are produced due to the abrasion of tires, brakes and the road.},

abstract = { Environmental justice research in the United States has coalesced around the notion that visible-minority status, along with socioeconomic position (SEP), conditions exposure to environmental health hazards. In the context of long-standing debates over Canada–USA urban differences, we address the question of whether racial gradients exist in air pollution across Hamilton, Canada. Monitored air quality data are spatially interpolated with a kriging algorithm. These interpolated exposures are statistically correlated with 1996 data at the census tract scale, with the aid of multivariate and spatial techniques. The proportion of Latin-Americans in a census tract is positively associated with pollution exposure, even after control for many SEP variables. In contrast, Asian-Canadians are negatively associated with air pollution, and Black-Canadians show no clear correlation at all. Thus, the faces of environmental racism in Canada seem more varied and nuanced than in the USA. Given the immigrant basis of visible minorities in Canada, we argue that Hamilton (and the Canadian city generally) may represent new dimensions of environmental racism driven by economic status at time of entry. In drawing on similar findings in the USA and the United Kingdom, the authors conclude that environmental racism appears present in all jurisdictions, but that the nature and extent of disproportionate exposure differ between countries. },

abstract = {Recent studies report that outdoor air pollution will become the main environmental cause of premature death over the next few decades (OECD, 2012; WHO, 2014; World Bank, 2016). Cities are considered hot spots and urban populations are particularly exposed. There is therefore an urgent need to adapt urban systems and urban design to tackle this issue. While most European cities have introduced measures to reduce emissions, action is still required to reduce concentrations and exposure, and a holistic approach to urban design is badly needed. The concept of urban resilience, defined by Holling (1987) as the ability of a city to absorb a disturbance while maintaining its functions and structures, may offer a new paradigm for tackling urban air pollution. We propose to adapt the concept of urban resilience to outdoor air pollution. A method has been developed to assess the resilience of an urban area to outdoor air pollution. Three “resilience capacities” have been identified: the capacity of an urban area to decrease air pollution emissions, the capacity to decrease concentrations and the capacity to decrease exposure. The calculation is based on the analysis of urban design, defined as the pattern of buildings as well as the structural elements that define an urban area (urban morphology; transport network, services and land use). For each resilience capacity, indicators are calculated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and a grid-based approach. This method has been implemented in the Greater Paris area within a 500m grid-cell system. Greater Paris is one of the densest urban areas in Europe and experiences high air pollution levels. The proposed “quick scan” method helps to localize areas where specific action is needed.},

This provides a whole new set of capabilities in the assessment of human exposure to air pollution. However, the data generated by these platforms are often of questionable quality. We have conducted an exhaustive evaluation of 24 identical units of a commercial low-cost sensor platform against CEN (European Standardization Organization) reference analyzers, evaluating their measurement capability over time and a range of environmental conditions. Our results show that their performance varies spatially and temporally, as it depends on the atmospheric composition and the meteorological conditions. Our results show that the performance varies from unit to unit, which makes it necessary to examine the data quality of each node before its use. In general, guidance is lacking on how to test such sensor nodes and ensure adequate performance prior to marketing these platforms. We have implemented and tested diverse metrics in order to assess if the sensor can be employed for applications that require high accuracy (i.e., to meet the Data Quality Objectives defined in air quality legislation, epidemiological studies) or lower accuracy (i.e., to represent the pollution level on a coarse scale, for purposes such as awareness raising). Data quality is a pertinent concern, especially in citizen science applications, where citizens are collecting and interpreting the data. In general, while low-cost platforms present low accuracy for regulatory or health purposes they can provide relative and aggregated information about the observed air quality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown an association between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and mortality. In Italy, the EpiAir multicentric study, "Air Pollution and Health: Epidemiological Surveillance and Primary Prevention," investigated short-term health effects of air pollution, including NO2. OBJECTIVES: To study the individual susceptibility, we evaluated the association between NO2 and cause-specific mortality, investigating individual sociodemographic features and chronic/acute medical conditions as potential effect modifiers. METHODS: We considered 276,205 natural deaths of persons {\textgreater} 35 years of age, resident in 10 Italian cities, and deceased between 2001 and 2005. We chose a time-stratified case-crossover analysis to evaluate the short-term effects of NO2 on natural, cardiac, cerebrovascular, and respiratory mortality. For each subject, we collected information on sociodemographic features and hospital admissions in the previous 2 years. Fixed monitors provided daily concentrations of NO2, particulate matter ≤ 10 $\mu$m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and ozone (O3). RESULTS: We found statistically significant associations with a 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase of NO2 for natural mortality [2.09{\%} for lag 0-5; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.96-3.24], for cardiac mortality (2.63{\%} for lag 0-5; 95{\%} CI, 1.53-3.75), and for respiratory mortality (3.48{\%} for lag 1-5; 95{\%} CI, 0.75-6.29). These associations were independent from those of PM10 and O3. Stronger associations were estimated for subjects with at least one hospital admission in the 2 previous years and for subjects with three or more specific chronic conditions. Some cardiovascular conditions (i.e., ischemic heart disease, pulmonary circulation impairment, heart conduction disorders, heart failure) and diabetes appeared to confer a strong susceptibility to air pollution. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest significant and likely independent effects of NO2 on natural, cardiac, and respiratory mortality, particularly among subjects with specific cardiovascular preexisting chronic conditions and diabetes.},

abstract = {The land-use regression (LUR) approach to estimate the levels of ambient air pollutants is becoming popular due to its high validity in predicting small-area variations. However, only a few studies have been conducted in Asian countries, and much less research has been conducted on comparing the performances and applied estimates of different exposure assessments including LUR. The main objectives of the current study were to conduct nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure assessment with four methods including LUR in the Republic of Korea, to compare the model performances, and to estimate the empirical NO2 exposures of a cohort. The study population was defined as the year 2010 participants of a government-supported cohort established for bio-monitoring in Ulsan, Republic of Korea. The annual ambient NO2 exposures of the 969 study participants were estimated with LUR, nearest station, inverse distance weighting, and ordinary kriging. Modeling was based on the annual NO2 average, traffic-related data, land-use data, and altitude of the 13 regularly monitored stations. The final LUR model indicated that area of transportation, distance to residential area, and area of wetland were important predictors of NO2. The LUR model explained 85.8{\%} of the variation observed in the 13 monitoring stations of the year 2009. The LUR model outperformed the others based on leave-one out cross-validation comparing the correlations and root-mean square error. All NO2 estimates ranged from 11.3-18.0 ppb, with that of LUR having the widest range. The NO2 exposure levels of the residents differed by demographics. However, the average was below the national annual guidelines of the Republic of Korea (30 ppb). The LUR models showed high performances in an industrial city in the Republic of Korea, despite the small sample size and limited data. Our findings suggest that the LUR method may be useful in similar settings in Asian countries where the target region is small and availability of data is low. {\textcopyright} 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduction: Particulate matter and air pollution in Korea are becoming worse. There is a lack of research regarding the impact of particulate matter on patients with COPD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of various air pollution factors, including particulate matter, on the incidence rate of severe acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) events. Methods: We analyzed the relationship between air pollutants and AECOPD events that required hospitalization at Guro Hospital in Korea from January 1, 2015 to May 31, 2017. We used general linear models with Poisson distribution and log-transformation to obtain adjusted relative risk (RR). We conducted further analysis through the Comprehensive Air-quality Index (CAI) that is used in Korea. Results: Among various other air pollutants, particulate matter was identified as a major source of air pollution in Korea. When the CAI score was over 50, the incidence rate of severe AECOPD events was statistically significantly higher [RR 1.612, 95{\%} CI, 1.065-2.440, P=0.024]. Additionally, the particulate matter levels 3 days before hospitalization were statistically significant [RR 1.003, 95{\%} CI, 1.001-1.005, P=0.006]. Conclusion: Particulate matter and air pollution increase the incidence rate of severe AECOPD events. COPD patients should be cautioned against outdoor activities when particulate matter levels are high.},

abstract = {Groundwater-level data of monitoring wells are often missed because of electrical power outage or digital-sensor problems. The missing data need to be interpolated using proper statistical methods, because they degrade the continuity of monitored data. In this study, kriging and conditional simulation were applied for the supplement of the missing groundwater-level data in alluvium and bedrock aquifer with peak type variations. Groundwater-level data of alluvial aquifer were artificially eliminated at the intervals of 10, 20, 40, and 60days to evaluate the capability of kriging and conditional simulation. Conditional simulation was statistically and graphically superior to kriging in the interpolations of 40days. Although conditional simulation produced larger statistical errors than kriging in the interpolations of 20 and 60days, it was more efficient than kriging in producing complicated fluctuations. The interpolated data produced using conditional simulation at the actual missing intervals of a groundwater monitoring well were also reproduced without errors from the original data and represented the fluctuations of original groundwater levels very well. However, conditional simulation has few limitations in the reproduction of fluctuations in the case of a very large missing interval or a very large difference in the data value of a missing interval.},

abstract = {As statistical approaches are getting increasingly used in linguistics, attention must be paid to the choice of methods and algorithms used. This is especially true since they require assumptions to be satisfied to provide valid results, and because scientific articles still often fall short of reporting whether such assumptions are met. Progress is being, however, made in various directions, one of them being the introduction of techniques able to model data that cannot be properly analyzed with simpler linear regression models. We report recent advances in statistical modeling in linguistics. We first describe linear mixed-effects regression models (LMM), which address grouping of observations, and generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM), which offer a family of distributions for the dependent variable. Generalized additive models (GAM) are then introduced, which allow modeling non-linear parametric or non-parametric relationships between the dependent variable and the predictors. We then highlight the possibilities offered by generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). We explain how they make it possible to go beyond common distributions, such as Gaussian or Poisson, and offer the appropriate inferential framework to account for ‘difficult' variables such as count data with strong overdispersion. We also demonstrate how they offer interesting perspectives on data when not only the mean of the dependent variable is modeled, but also its variance, skewness, and kurtosis. As an illustration, the case of phonemic inventory size is analyzed throughout the article. For over 1,500 languages, we consider as predictors the number of speakers, the distance from Africa, an estimation of the intensity of language contact, and linguistic relationships. We discuss the use of random effects to account for genealogical relationships, the choice of appropriate distributions to model count data, and non-linear relationships. Relying on GAMLSS, we assess a range of candidate distributions, including the Sichel, Delaporte, Box-Cox Green and Cole, and Box-Cox t distributions. We find that the Box-Cox t distribution, with appropriate modeling of its parameters, best fits the conditional distribution of phonemic inventory size. We finally discuss the specificities of phoneme counts, weak effects, and how GAMLSS should be considered for other linguistic variables.},

Whether natural (cyclone, earthquake, flood) or human (industrial accident) in origin, catastrophic situations modify both infrastructures (buildings, road networks) and human behaviors, which can have a huge impact on human safety. Because the heterogeneities of human behaviors, of land-uses and of network topology have a great impact on the traffic flows, the agent-based modeling is particularly adapted to this subject. In this paper, we focus on the new traffic model itself: the way geographical data is used to build a network, the various behaviors of our agents, from the individual to the collective level.},

abstract = {PM10 concentrations exceed the guidelines in some Swedish cities and the limit values will likely be further reduced in the future. In order to gain more knowledge of emission factors for road traffic and concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5, existing monitoring stations in two cities, Gothenburg and Ume{\aa}, with international E-road thoroughfares, were complemented with some PM2.5 measurements. Emission factors for PM10 and PM2.5 were estimated using NOX as a tracer. Monitoring data from kerbside and urban background sites in Gothenburg during 2006-2010 and in Ume{\aa}during 2006-2012 were used. NOX emissions were estimated from the traffic flow and emission factors calculated from the HBEFA3.1 model. PM2.5 constitutes the finer part of PM10. Emissions of the coarser part of PM10 (PM10-PM2.5) are suppressed when roads are wet and show a maximum during spring when the roads dry up and studded tyres are still used. Less than 1{\%} of the road wear caused by studded tyres give rise to airborne PM2.5-10 particles. The NOX emission factors decrease with time in the used model, due to the renewal of the vehicle fleet. However, the NOX concentrations resulting from the roads show no clear trend. The air dispersion is an important factor controlling the PM concentration near the road. The dispersion has a minimum in winter and during midnight. The average street level concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 in Gothenburg were 21 ± 20 and 8 ± 6 {\$}\mu{\$}g m-3 respectively, which is 36{\%} and 22{\%} higher than the urban background concentrations. Despite the four times lower traffic flow in Ume{\aa}compared to Gothenburg, the average particle concentrations were very similar; 21 ± 31 and 7 ± 5 {\$}\mu{\$}g m-3 for PM10 and PM2.5 respectively. These concentrations were, however, 108{\%} and 55{\%} higher than the urban background concentrations in Ume{\aa}. The emission factors for PM10 decreased with time, and the average factor was 0.06 g km-1 vehichle-1. The emission factors for PM2.5 are very uncertain due to the small increments in PM2.5 concentration at the thoroughfares, and were on average 0.02 g km-1 vehichle-1.},

abstract = {Looking at kriging problems with huge numbers of estimation points and measurements, computational power and storage capacities often pose heavy limitations to the maximum manageable problem size. In the past, a list of FFT-based algorithms for matrix operations have been developed. They allow extremely fast convolution, superposition and inversion of covariance matrices under certain conditions. If adequately used in kriging problems, these algorithms lead to drastic speedup and reductions in storage requirements without changing the kriging estimator. However, they require second-order stationary covariance functions, estimation on regular grids, and the measurements must also form a regular grid. In this study, we show how to alleviate these rather heavy and many times unrealistic restrictions. Stationarity can be generalized to intrinsicity and beyond, if decomposing kriging problems into the sum of a stationary problem and a formally decoupled regression task. We use universal kriging, because it covers arbitrary forms of unknown drift and all cases of generalized covariance functions. Even more general, we use an extension to uncertain rather than unknown drift coefficients. The sampling locations may now be irregular, but must form a subset of the estimation grid. Finally, we present asymptotically exact but fast approximations to the estimation variance and point out application to conditional simulation, cokriging and sequential kriging. The drastic gain in computational and storage efficiency is demonstrated in test cases. Especially high-resolution and data-rich fields such as rainfall interpolation from radar measurements or seismic or other geophysical inversion can benefit from these improvements.},

abstract = {The American Thoracic Society has previously published statements on what constitutes an adverse effect on health of air pollution in 1985 and 2000. We set out to update and broaden these past statements that focused primarily on effects on the respiratory system. Since then, many studies have documented effects of air pollution on other organ systems, such as on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. In addition, many new biomarkers of effects have been developed and applied in air pollution studies. This current report seeks to integrate the latest science into a general framework for interpreting the adversity of the human health effects of air pollution. Rather than trying to provide a catalogue of what is and what is not an adverse effect of air pollution, we propose a set of considerations that can be applied in forming judgments of the adversity of not only currently documented, but also emerging and future effects of air pollution on human health. These considerations are illustrated by the inclusion of examples for different types of health effects of air pollution.},

abstract = {Over the last several years, the U.S. economy has experienced a significant recession brought on by the collapse of the residential real estate market. During this downturn, the number of real estate foreclosures has risen drastically. Recent studies have empirically demonstrated a reduction in real estate values due to neighboring foreclosures, termed the foreclosure contagion effect. The foreclosure contagion effect impacts healthy neighboring properties that surround the foreclosed property as a function of both time and distance. We mathematically specify a precise equation that identifies the foreclosure contagion threshold, that is, the boundary that separates surviving markets from those that crash. Using a new technique to our field known as Latin Hypercube Sampling, we presents the results of a large scale sensitivity analysis to find that beyond the foreclosure discount and disposition time variables, the percentage of adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) and the foreclosure distance discount weight are the two secondary most contributing causes to a market collapse. {\textcopyright}2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {This paper develops an agent-based model of the daily commute in Aberdeen City and the surrounding area in Scotland, UK. We study the impact of flexitime work arrangements, urban concentration, a new bypass, and cycle lanes on commute time length, reliability and CO2 emissions, and analyse the diverse conflation of these factors and the different connections of them in order to detect their cumulative effects. Our results suggest that flexitime will reduce CO2 emissions from traffic. It also reduces mean commute time and makes commute time more reliable. We find that although higher urban concentration will make travel time less reliable, it will reduce CO2 emissions from commuting and cut commute time length. There might also be a trade-off between travel time length and reliability regarding urban concentration. We show that the new bypass will only reduce mean commute time by a small amount, while slightly increasing total CO2 emissions. Finally, we find that cyclists sharing roads with cars do not necessarily slow down the traffic on the whole. We conclude that infrastructural, social and urban issues should never be studied in isolation with each other, and that urban policies will have ramifications for both urban and surrounding ex-urban areas.},

We apply the tool to the US emissions inventory to better understand the contribution of each economic sector on reduced air quality. We show that, even for a national assessment, local (e.g., subcounty) information is important to capture the variability in health impacts that exist on fine scales.

abstract = {The Treadwear Rating (TWR) provided on the sidewall of the tyre is a marking intended to inform the customer about the expected durability of the tyre. The current study explores whether there is a correlation between the TWR and tyres' tread mass loss. Furthermore, it explores the possible correlation between the TWR and tyre wear dust emitted in the form of PM10 and PM2.5. For that reason, two tyres of the same brand (B) but with different TWR and three tyres of different brands (C and D with the same TWR as one of the B tyres and A with a lower TWR) were tested at a constant speed of 70 km/h by means of the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) road simulator. Tyres of the same TWR but of different brands showed different behaviour in terms of material loss, PM, and PN emissions under the selected testing conditions. This means that it is not feasible to categorize tyres of different brands in terms of their emissions based on their TWR. The test performed on the two tyres of the same brand but with different TWR showed instead a substantial (not statistically significant) difference in both total wear and PM10 emissions. The tyre with the higher TWR (B2) showed less wear and PM10 emissions compared to the B1 tyre having a lower TWR. Since only two tyres of the same brand and with different TWR were tested, this result cannot be generalized and more tests are necessary to confirm the relation within the same brand. In general, the tyre tread mass loss showed no obvious statistical relation to PM10, PM2.5 or PN concentration. In all cases approximately 50{\%} (by mass) of emitted PM10 fall within the size range of fine particles, while PN size distribution is dominated by nanoparticles most often peaking at 20–30 nm.},

As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design rationale, the model's underlying narrative, and the means by which the model's fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model. Thereby ODD would provide a lingua franca for simulation modelling.},

abstract = {Journey-time exposures to particulate air pollution were investigated in Leicester, UK, between January and March 2005. Samples of TSP, PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 were simultaneously collected using light scattering devices whilst journeys were made by walking an in-car. Over a period of two months, 33 pairs of walking and in-car measurements were collected along two circular routes. Average exposures while walking were seen to be higher than those found in-car for each of the particle fractions: average walking to in-car ratios were 1.2 (± 0.6), 1.5 (± 0.6), 1.3 (± 0.6), and 1.4 (± 0.6) $\mu$gm−3 for coarse (TSP–PM10), intermediate (PM10–PM2.5), fine (PM2.5–PM1), and very fine particles (PM1), respectively. Correlations between walking and in-car exposures were seen to be weak for coarse particles (r=0.10, p=0.58), moderate for the intermediate particles (r=0.49, p{\textless}0.01) but strong for fine (r=0.89, p{\textless}0.01) and very fine (r=0.90, P{\textless}0.01) particles. PM10 exposures while walking were on average 70{\%} higher than a nearby roadside fixed-site monitor whilst in-car exposures were 25{\%} higher than the same fixed-site monitor. Particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5$\mu$m were seen to be highly correlated between walking and in-car particle exposures and a rural fixed-site monitor about 30km south of Leicester.},

abstract = {Better understanding of the complex links between urban transportation, land use, air quality, and population exposure is needed to improve urban sustainability. A goal of this study was to develop an exposure modeling framework that integrates agent-based activity and travel simulation with air pollution modeling for Tampa, Florida. We aimed to characterize exposure and exposure inequality for traffic-related air pollution, and to investigate the impacts of high-resolution information on estimated exposure. To do these, we developed and applied a modeling framework that combines the DaySim activity-based travel demand model, the MATSim dynamic traffic assignment model, the MOVES mobile source emissions estimator, and the R-LINE dispersion model. Resulting spatiotemporal distributions of daily individual human activity and pollutant concentration were matched to analyze population and subgroup exposure to oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) from passenger car travel for an average winter day in 2010. Four scenarios using data with different spatiotemporal resolutions were considered: a) high resolution for both activities and concentrations, b) low resolution for both activities and concentrations, c) high resolution for activities, but low resolution for concentrations, and d) vice versa. For the high-resolution scenario, the mean daily population exposure concentration of NO x from passenger cars was 10.2 {\$}\mu{\$}g/m 3 ; individual exposure concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 145 {\$}\mu{\$}g/m 3 . Subgroup mean exposure was higher than the population mean for individuals living below-poverty (by {\~{}}16{\%}), those with daily travel time over one hour (8{\%}), adults aged 19–45 (7{\%}), blacks (6{\%}), Hispanics (4{\%}), Asians (2{\%}), combined other non-white races (2{\%}), people from middle income households (2{\%}), and residents of urban areas (2{\%}). The subgroup inequality index (a measure of disparity) largely increased with concentration up to the 90th percentile level for these groups. At higher levels, disparities increased sharply for individuals from below poverty households, blacks, and Hispanics. Low-resolution simulation of both activities and concentrations decreased the exposure estimates by 10{\%} on average, with differences ranging from eight times higher to {\~{}}90{\%} lower.},

abstract = {Daily exposures to ambient oxides of nitrogen were estimated here for residents of Hillsborough County, FL. The 2009 National Household Travel Survey provided geocoded data on fixed activity locations during each person-day sampled. Routes between activity locations were calculated from transportation network data, assuming the quickest travel path. To estimate daily exposure concentrations for each person-day, the exposure locations were matched with diurnally and spatially varying ambient pollutant concentrations derived from CALPUFF dispersion model results. The social distribution of exposures was analyzed by comparing frequency distributions of grouped daily exposure concentrations and by regression modeling. To investigate exposure error, the activity-based exposure estimates were also compared with estimates derived using residence location alone. The mean daily activity-based exposure concentration for the study sample was 17 $\mu$g/m3, with values for individual person-day records ranging from 7.0 to 43 $\mu$g/m3. The highest mean exposure concentrations were found for the following groups: black (20 $\mu$g/m3), below poverty (18 $\mu$g/m3), and urban residence location (22 $\mu$g/m3). Urban versus rural residence was associated with the largest increase in exposure concentration in the regression (8.3 $\mu$g/m3). Time in nonresidential activities, including travel, was associated with an increase of 0.2 $\mu$g/m3 per hour. Time spent travelling and at nonresidential locations contributed an average of 6 and 24 {\%}, respectively, to the daily estimate. A mean error of 3.6 {\%}, with range from −64 to 58 {\%}, was found to result from using residence location alone. Exposure error was highest for those who travel most, but lowest for the sociodemographic subgroups with higher mean exposure concentrations (including blacks and those from below poverty households). This work indicates the importance of urbanicity to social disparities in activity-based air pollution exposures. It also suggests that exposure error due to using residence location may be smaller for more exposed groups.},

abstract = {Monitoring of environmental contaminants is a critical part of exposure sciences research and public health practice. Missing data are often encountered when performing short-term monitoring ({\textless}24 h) of air pollutants with real-time monitors, especially in resource-limited areas. Approaches for handling consecutive periods of missing and incomplete data in this context remain unclear. Our aim is to evaluate existing imputation methods for handling missing data for real-time monitors operating for short durations. In a current field-study, realtime PM2.5 monitors were placed outside of 20 households and ran for 24-hours. Missing data was simulated in these households at four consecutive periods of missingness (20{\%}, 40{\%}, 60{\%}, 80{\%}). Univariate (Mean, Median, Last Observation Carried Forward, Kalman Filter, Random, Markov) and multivariate time-series (Predictive Mean Matching, Row Mean Method) methods were used to impute missing concentrations, and performance was evaluated using five error metrics (Absolute Bias, Percent Absolute Error in Means, R2 Coefficient of Determination, Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error). Univariate methods of Markov, random, and mean imputations were the best performing methods that yielded 24-hour mean concentrations with the lowest error and highest R2 values across all levels of missingness. When evaluating error metrics minute-by-minute, Kalman filters, median, and Markov methods performed well at low levels of missingness (20–40{\%}). However, at higher levels of missingness (60–80{\%}), Markov, random, median, and mean imputation performed best on average. Multivariate methods were the worst performing imputation methods across all levels of missingness. Imputation using univariate methods may provide a reasonable solution to addressing missing data for short-term monitoring of air pollutants, especially in resource-limited areas. Further efforts are needed to evaluate imputation methods that are generalizable across a diverse range of study environments.},

Methods: We used modeled PM2.5 concentration data for the basic administrative levels, comprising the cities and the provinces of Korea, the corresponding annual population census data for each level, and the age and cause specific mortality data. We applied cause-specific integrated exposure-response functions to calculate the premature mortality attributable to ambient PM2.5 for four disease end points (ischemic heart disease [IHD], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], lung cancer [LC], and cerebrovascular disease [stroke]) for the year 2015. Moreover, the temporal trends of the health burden from 2006 to 2015 were assessed. Results: The annual average PM2.5 concentration for Korea was 24.4 {\$}\mu{\$}g/m3, and 11,924 premature deaths were attributable to PM2.5 exposure in 2015. By simulating the reduction in the annual mean values of PM2.5 to 10 {\$}\mu{\$}g/m3, about 8,539 premature deaths were preventable. There was spatial variation in mortality burden attributable to PM2.5 across the sub-national regions of Korea. In particular, the high burden was concentrated at Seoul and Gyeonggi province due to the high population density. However, decreasing trends were noted for most of the metropolitan cities and provinces of Korea since 2006. Conclusion: Our findings show that further actions to improve air quality in Korea would substantially improve the health burden due to particulate matter.},

In addition to determination of sample mass, concentrations have been determined for major chemical components as follows: sulphate, nitrate, chloride, organic carbon, elemental carbon, iron and calcium. The measured concentrations have been converted to equivalent quantities of ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate (in PM2.5), sodium nitrate (in PM2.5-10), sodium chloride, elemental carbon, carbon compounds, gypsum and iron-rich dusts. The mass of strongly bound water has also been calculated following the mass closure methodology of Harrison et al. (Atmos. Environ. 37 (2003) 4927). Examination of the difference between roadside (mean 34.7$\mu$gm-3PM10) and corresponding urban background (mean 23.2$\mu$gm-3PM10) samples indicates average mass increments of 11.5$\mu$gm-3of PM10and 8.0$\mu$gm-3of PM2.5for the four site pairs, and that the roadside particle increment is comprised very largely of elemental carbon, organic compounds and iron-rich dusts. The major component composition lies somewhere between that reported as typical of the eastern and western US. A comparison with PM2.5and PM15sampled in Leeds (UK) in 1982 shows a decline in all major constituents except mineral dusts (PM2.5only). In a comparison of data for days with PM10above the EU 24-h Limit Value of 50$\mu$gm-3with data from all days, the component showing the greatest ratio between high pollution days and all days is fine particle nitrate. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a well-established traffic emissions tracer and has been associated with multiple adverse health outcomes. Short- and long-term exposure to NO2 has been studied and is well-documented in existing literature, but information on intermediate-term NO2 effects and mortality is lacking, despite biological plausibility. We obtained daily NO2 and mortality data from 42 counties in China from 2013 to 2015. Distributed-lag non-linear models were employed to investigate the relationship between non-accidental mortality and NO2 up to 30 days before the event, including PM2.5, temperature, relative humidity, and holidays as covariates in a random effects meta-analysis pooling county-specific estimates. We repeated the analysis for cardiovascular- and respiratory-related mortality, and explored sex-stratified associations. Per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in NO2, we estimated a 0.13{\%} (95{\%}CI: 0.03, 0.23{\%}), 0.57{\%} (95{\%}CI: −0.04, 1.18{\%}), and −0.14{\%} (95{\%}CI: −1.63, 1.37{\%}) change in non-accidental mortality for same-day and previous-day NO2 (lag0-1 cumulated), in the preceding 7 days (lag0-7 cumulated), and in the preceding 30 days (lag0-30 cumulated), respectively. The strongest estimate was observed for respiratory-related mortality in the lag0-30 cumulated effect for women (3.12{\%}; 95{\%}CI: −1.66, 8.13{\%}). We observed a trend of higher effect estimates of intermediate-term NO2 exposure on respiratory mortality compared to that of the short-term, although the differences were not statistically significant. Our results at longer lags for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were sensitive to modeling choices. Future work should further investigate intermediate-term air pollution exposure given their potential biological relevance, but in larger scale settings.},

abstract = {We assessed whether long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality during a period of declining particulate matter concentrations. Approximately 4800 women aged 55 years from North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, were followed for up to 18 years. Exposure to air pollution was assessed in two ways: (1) using the distance between the residential address and the nearest major road, as calculated from Geographic Information System data and (2) calculating 1-year average particulate matter concentrations below 10 {\&}mm (PM 10 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) levels using data from the nearest air-monitoring station data to the subjects' residences. Ninety-two per cent of all subjects lived in the same community during the entire follow-up period. Associations between mortality and exposure were assessed using Cox's proportional hazards models, including confounder adjustment. Sixteen per cent of women passed away during the follow-up period. An increase of 7 {\&}mg/m 3 PM 10 (IQR) was associated with an increased HR for all-cause (HR 1.15, 95{\%} CI (1.04 to 1.27)), cardiopulmonary (HR 1.39, 95{\%} CI (1.17 to 1.64)), and lung cancer mortality (HR 1.84, 95{\%} CI (1.23 to 2.74)). An increase of 16 {\&}m;g/m 3 (IQR) NO2 exposure was associated with all-cause (HR 1.18, 95{\%} CI (1.07 to 1.30)) and cardiopulmonary mortality (HR 1.55, 95{\%} CI (1.30 to 1.84)). The association between cardiopulmonary mortality and PM 10 was reduced for the extended follow-up period, during which PM 10 concentrations (but not NO 2 concentrations) were lower. Living close to a major road was associated with an increased relative risk for all-cause, cardiopulmonary and respiratory mortality. These associations were temporally stable. Long-term exposure to ambient PM 10 and NO 2 was associated with increased mortality rates.},

This review discusses widely used methods with a special focus on new developments. RECENT FINDINGS: New data and study designs have been applied, including satellite measurements of fine particles and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)). The methods to apply satellite data for epidemiological studies are improving rapidly and have already contributed significantly to national-, continental- and global-scale models. Spatiotemporal models have been developed allowing more detailed temporal resolution compared to spatial models. The development of hybrid models combining dispersion models, satellite observations, land use and surface monitoring has improved models substantially. Mobile monitoring designs to develop models for long-term UFP exposure have been conducted. Methods to assess long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution have improved significantly over the past decade. Application of satellite data and mobile monitoring designs is promising new methods.},

abstract = {Studies on the health effects of long-term average exposure to outdoor air pollution have played an important role in recent health impact assessments. Exposure assessment for epidemiological studies of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution remains a difficult challenge because of substantial small-scale spatial variation. Current approaches for assessing intra-urban air pollution contrasts include the use of exposure indicator variables, interpolation methods, dispersion models and land-use regression (LUR) models. LUR models have been increasingly used in the past few years. This paper provides a critical review of the different components of LUR models. We identified 25 land-use regression studies. Land-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20-100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems (GIS). Monitoring is usually temporally limited: one to four surveys of typically one or two weeks duration. Significant predictor variables include various traffic representations, population density, land use, physical geography (e.g. altitude) and climate. Land-use regression methods have generally been applied successfully to model annual mean concentrations of NO2, NOx, PM2.5, the soot content of PM2.5 and VOCs in different settings, including European and North-American cities. The performance of the method in urban areas is typically better or equivalent to geo-statistical methods, such as kriging, and dispersion models. Further developments of the land-use regression method include more focus on developing models that can be transferred to other areas, inclusion of additional predictor variables such as wind direction or emission data and further exploration of focalsum methods. Models that include a spatial and a temporal component are of interest for (e.g. birth cohort) studies that need exposure variables on a finer temporal scale. There is a strong need for validation of LUR models with personal exposure monitoring. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many European countries have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing nationwide protection measures and lockdowns1. However, the epidemic could rebound when such measures are relaxed, possibly leading to a requirement for a second or more, repeated lockdowns2. Here, we present results of a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. We examined the potential impact of post-lockdown measures, including physical distancing, mask-wearing and shielding individuals who are the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, on cumulative disease incidence and mortality, and on intensive care unit (ICU)-bed occupancy. While lockdown is effective in containing the viral spread, once lifted, regardless of duration, it would be unlikely to prevent a rebound. Both physical distancing and mask-wearing, although effective in slowing the epidemic and in reducing mortality, would also be ineffective in ultimately preventing ICUs from becoming overwhelmed and a subsequent second lockdown. However, these measures coupled with the shielding of vulnerable people would be associated with better outcomes, including lower mortality and maintaining an adequate ICU capacity to prevent a second lockdown. Benefits would nonetheless be markedly reduced if most people do not adhere to these measures, or if they are not maintained for a sufficiently long period.},

abstract = {In order to give an effective and rapid analysis of the photochemical pollution and information for emission control strategies, a photochemical box model (PBM) was applied to one moderate summer episode, 11 July 1996, and one typical winter episode, 3 December 1996, in the center of Tokyo, Japan. The box model gave a good prediction of the photochemical pollution with minimal investment. As expected, the peak ozone in summer is higher than in winter. The NOx concentrations in winter are higher than those in summer. In summer, NO and NO2 have one peak in the morning. In winter, NO and NO2 show two peaks during the day. Three model runs including no reactions, a zero ozone boundary condition and dark reactions were conducted to understand the photochemical processes. The effects of emission reduction on the formation of the photochemical pollution in the center of Tokyo have been studied. The results show that the reduction of NMHC emission can decrease the ozone, however, the reduction of NOx emission can increase the ozone. It can be concluded that if the NOx emission are reduced, the reduction of NMHC should be more emphasized in order to decrease the ozone concentration in the center of Tokyo, Japan, especially the reduction of the NMHC from stationary source emission.},

Traffic-related air pollution is modelled as detailed as possible while still being applicable to large-scale scenarios. Simulated hourly mean nitrogen oxide (NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}x{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) concentrations are compared with concentration measurements showing a similar pollution level and diurnal pattern at a site along a street canyon in Munich, Germany. Nitrogen dioxide (NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) emissions and concentrations are simulated for an area bounded by the major ring road of Munich, Germany.

The cause-and-effect chain from the traffic activity towards the concentration of air pollutants is complex. Modeling the outcome needs a lot of inputs in terms of methodology and data. Against this background, an approach is developed that links the agent-based transport model MATSim with the emission factors and traffic situations of HBEFA. The goal is to approximate link travel times as well as the resulting emissions of air pollutants while still being applicable to large-scale scenarios. This paper aims at laying down the foundations for this innovative approach. A test case is developed where link travel times are simulated and the resulting emissions are calculated for MATSim test vehicles. The results are then compared to real-world data. Further, it is discussed how to extend this approach to a large-scale scenario and what prerequisites are needed. Finally, it is analyzed what additional information the model provides in order to achieve a more sustainable transport and urban planning.},

abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm that follows the sample-free approach to synthesise a population for agent based modelling purposes. This algorithm is among the very few in the literature that do not rely on a sample survey data to construct a synthetic population, and thus enjoy a potentially wider applications where such survey data is not available or inaccessible. Different to existing sample-free algorithms, the population synthesis presented in this paper applies the heuristics to part of the allocation of synthetic individuals into synthetic households. As a result the iterative process allocating individuals into households, which normally is the most computationally demanding and time consuming process, is required only for a subset of synthetic individuals. The population synthesiser in this work is therefore computational efficient enough for practical application to build a large synthetic population (many millions) for many thousands target areas at the smallest possible geographical level. This capability ensures that the geographical heterogeneity of the resulting synthetic population is best preserved. The paper also presents the application of the new method to synthesise the population for New South Wales in Australia in 2006. The resulting total synthetic population has approximately 6 million people living in over 2.3 million households residing in private dwellings across over 11000 Census Collection Districts. Analyses show evidence that the synthetic population matches very well with the census data across seven demographics attributes that characterise the population at both household level and individual level.},

Technicians carried a nephelometer to detect various sizes of PM while engaging in one of nine scripted time–location–activity patterns. The scripted activities were based on the time–activity patterns of nine groups of inhabitants of Seoul, Korea. The monitoring was repeated in summer and winter to assess seasonal variation. The differences of personal exposures to PM10 and PM2.5 in summer and winter were not significant. The greatest PM concentrations occurred in restaurants. The PM2.5/PM10 ratios were varied from 0.35 at schools to 0.92 at stores. In both seasons, the residential indoor microenvironment was the largest contributor to personal PM exposure. The other major contributors were restaurants, offices, schools, buses, and walking, although their contributions differed by season and particle size. The different microenvironmental contributions among the activity pattern groups suggest that personal exposure significantly differs according to activity pattern.},

Indoor air quality was monitored in both buildings. One-hundred-and-ninety-four randomly selected individuals were interviewed in the afternoon exiting the buildings and de-identified responses were recorded. Self-reported DE symptoms were modeled with respect to experimental and control buildings, adjusting for potential confounders. The experimental site had 2-fold higher concentration of airborne particulate matter (24,436 vs. 12,213 ≥ 0.5 µm/ft(3)) and microbial colonies (1066 vs. 400/m(3)), as compared to the control building. DE symptoms were reported by 37.5{\%} of individuals exiting the experimental and 28.4{\%} exiting the control building. In the univariate analysis, subjects exiting the experimental building were 2.21× more likely to report worsening of DE symptoms since morning compared to the control building (p {\textless} 0.05). When adjusting for confounders, including a history of eye allergy, subjects from the experimental building were 13.3× more likely to report worsening of their DE symptoms (p {\textless} 0.05). Our findings suggest that short-term exposure to adverse indoor environmental conditions, specifically air pollution and bioaerosols, has an acutely negative impact on DE symptoms.},

abstract = {The authors address two research questions: (1) Are populations with lower socioeconomic status, compared with people of higher socioeconomic status, more likely to be exposed to higher levels of particulate air pollution in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada? (2) How sensitive is the association between levels of particulate air pollution and socioeconomic status to specification of exposure estimates or statistical models? Total suspended particulate (TSP) data from the twenty-three monitoring stations in Hamilton (1985 - 94) were interpolated with a universal kriging procedure to develop an estimate of likely pollution values across the city based on annual geometric means and extreme events. Comparing the highest with the lowest exposure zones, the interpolated surfaces showed more than a twofold increase in TSP concentrations and more than a twentyfold difference in the probability of exposure to extreme events. Exposure estimates were related to socioeconomic and demographic data from census tract areas by using ordinary least squares and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models. Control for spatial autocorrelation in the SAR models allowed for tests of how robust specific socioeconomic variables were for predicting pollution exposure. Dwelling values were significantly and negatively associated with pollution exposure, a result robust to the method of statistical analysis. Low income and unemployment were also significant predictors of exposure, although results varied depending on the method of analysis. Relatively minor changes in the statistical models altered the significant variables. This result emphasizes the value of geographical information systems (GIS) and spatial statistical techniques in modelling exposure. The result also shows the importance of taking spatial autocorrelation into account in future justice - health studies.},

To obtain the quantitative result of the impact of particulate air pollution on human health and the subsequent economic costs in Shanghai, we used epidemiology-based exposure-response functions to calculate the attributable number of cases due to particulate air pollution in urban areas of Shanghai in 2001, and then we estimated the corresponding economic costs of the health damage based on unit values of the health outcomes. It was estimated that the total economic cost of health impacts due to particulate air pollution in urban areas of Shanghai in 2001 was approximately 625.40 million US dollars, accounting for 1.03{\%} of gross domestic product of the city. The results suggest that the impact of particulate air pollution on human health could be substantial in urban Shanghai, whether in physical and economic terms. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

During an intensive 12-day exposure measurement campaign, groups of four volunteers sampled twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon along Marylebone Road. They were randomly designated a walking direction, walking position (kerbside or buildingside) and a side of the major road to walk along. PM2.5 was sampled using high-flow gravimetric personal samplers, ultrafine particle counts were measured using TSI P-TRAKs and Langans were used to measure CO exposure. PM2.5 samples were analysed gravimetrically and reflectance was measured using a smoke stain reflectometer to obtain a measure of 'black smoke'. In total 603 acceptable samples were obtained - 155 PM2.5 and reflectance, 120 ultrafine particle count and 173 CO. The average pedestrian exposure along the road was 37.7 ??g/m3, 12.1 m -1??10-5, 80 009 pt/cm3 and 1.3 ppm for PM2.5, loss of reflectance, ultrafine particle counts and CO, respectively. PM2.5 exposure in the morning was significantly higher than in the afternoon, and there was a significant difference in exposure on the different sides of the road. For both reflectance and ultrafine particle counts, the exposure was significantly different both between the two walking positions on the pavement and the two sides of the street canyon. However there was no significant difference in CO exposure based on walking position, walking direction, canyon side or timing. Filter reflectance was significantly but weakly correlated with PM2.5 exposure (r=0.3, N=155), CO exposure (r=0.2, N=154) and ultrafine particle count exposure (r=0.7, N=108). PM 2.5 and CO personal exposure measurements were much higher than those recorded at both the local background fixed monitoring station (FMS) and a kerbside FMS, but PM2.5 personal exposure was significantly correlated with the PM2.5 concentrations at the background FMS (r=0.6, N=155). ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Emissions of combustion aerosol by transport activities near residential areas are associated with adverse health effects. The composition of combustion aerosol from road traffic, a harbour and an airstrip has been investigated by measurements of PM
2.5
, elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and size-resolved particle number concentrations (PNC). PM
2.5
concentrations are not significantly increased downwind of transport activities. Combustion aerosol from road traffic is identified by EC, OC and PNC and an airstrip by OC and a large number of nucleation particles (i.e. particles smaller than 25 nm). Combustion emissions from a harbour have not been distinguished from background concentrations probable due to the height of these emissions and their large temporal variability. EC is suggested (over OC and PNC) as an indicator for the mass of combustion emissions by road traffic. EC is more stable during dispersion, has a higher contrast against background concentrations and is relatively easy to monitor. From our study on size-resolved PNC downwind of a motorway, it is concluded that dispersion of PNC from road traffic may be modelled as a conservative parameter on a medium city scale. The modelled spatial distribution of EC and PNC in the city of Rotterdam shows that EC is elevated both near urban and motorway traffic, while PNC has the highest relative values near motorway traffic. This illustrates that the urban population is exposed to different levels and composition of combustion aerosol which may result in different health impacts.

At these stations both subway worker areas (station offices, rest areas, ticket offices and driver compartments) and passengers areas (station precincts, subway carriages and platforms) were the sites used for measuring the levels of PM. The mean concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 were relatively higher on platforms, inside subway carriages and in driver compartments than in the other areas monitored. The levels of PM10 and PM2.5 for station precincts and platforms exceeded the 24-h acceptable threshold limits of 150$\mu$g/m3 for PM10 and 35$\mu$g/m3 for PM2.5, which are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Given the annual averages, we developed ordinary kriging prediction models for each of the seven major cities and for the entire country by using an exponential covariance reference model and a maximum likelihood estimation method.

Cross-validated R(2) values in Seoul and Busan were 0.31 and 0.23, respectively, whereas the other five cities had R(2) values of zero. The national model produced a higher crossvalidated R(2) (0.36) than those for the city-specific models.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: In general, the ordinary kriging models performed poorly for the seven major cities and the entire country of South Korea, but the model performance was better in the national model. To improve model performance, future studies should examine different prediction approaches that incorporate PM10 source characteristics.},

abstract = {Many large neighbourhoods are located near heavy-traffic roads; therefore, it is necessary to control the levels of air pollution near road exposure. The primary air pollutants emitted by motor vehicles are CO, NO2 and PM. Various investigations identify key health outcomes to be consistently associated with NO2 and CO. The objective of this study was the measurement-based assessment for determining whether by high-traffic roads, such as motorways and express ways, and the concentrations of CO and NO2 are within normal limits and do not pose threat to the local population. Average daily values (arithmetic values calculated for 1-h values within 24 h or less, depending on result availability) were measured for concentrations of NO2 and CO by automatic stations belonging to the Voivodship Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Katowice, in areas with similar dominant source of pollutant emission. The measurements were made in three sites: near the motorway and expressway, where the average daily traffic intensity is 100983 and 35414 of vehicles relatively. No evidence was found of exceeding average daily values equal to the maximum allowable NO2 concentration due to the protection of human health in the measurement area of the stations. No daily average values exceeding the admissible CO concentration (8-h moving average) were noted in the examined period. The results clearly show lack of hazards for general population health in terms of increased concentrations of CO and NO2 compounds that are closely related to high intensity car traffic found on selected motorways and speedways located near the city centres.},

abstract = {Health effect estimates depend on the methods of evaluating exposures. Due to non-linearities in the exposure-response relationships, both the predicted mean exposures as well as its spatial variability are significant. The aim of this work is to systematically quantify the impact of the spatial resolution on population-weighted mean concentration (PWC), its variance, and mortality attributable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in Finland in 2015. The atmospheric chemical transport model SILAM was used to estimate the ambient air PM2.5 concentrations at 0.02° longitudinal × 0.01° latitudinal resolution (ca. 1 km), including both the national PM2.5 emissions and the long-range transport. The decision-support model FRES source-receptor matrices applied at 250-m resolution was used to model the ambient air concentrations of primary fine particulate matter (PPM2.5) from local and regional sources up to 10 km and 20 km distances. Numerical averaging of population and concentrations was used to produce the results for coarser resolutions. Population-weighted PM2.5 concentration was 11{\%} lower at a resolution of 50 km, compared with the corresponding computations at a resolution of 1 km. However, considering only the national emissions, the influences of spatial averaging were substantially larger. The average population-weighted local PPM2.5 concentration originated from Finnish sources was 70{\%} lower at a resolution of 50 km, compared with the corresponding result obtained using a resolution of 250 m. The sensitivity to spatial averaging, between the finest 250-m and the coarsest 50-km resolution, was highest for the emissions of PPM2.5 originated from national vehicular traffic (about 80{\%} decrease) and lowest for the national residential combustion (60{\%} decrease). Exposure estimates in urban areas were more sensitive to the changes of model resolution (14{\%} and 74{\%} decrease for PM2.5 and local PPM2.5, respectively), compared with estimates in rural areas (2{\%} decrease for PM2.5 and 36{\%} decrease for PPM2.5). We conclude that for the evaluation of the health impacts of air pollution, the resolution of the model computations is an important factor, which can potentially influence the predicted health impacts by tens of percent or more, especially when assessing the impacts of national emissions.},

The species- and time- adjusted no-observed-adverse-effect-concentration (NOAEC) for respirable TRWP was 55 µg/m3. This NOAEC was compared to exposure estimates for respirable TRWP for both typical and worst case exposure scenarios based on age-specific activity patterns to determine the margin of exposure for TRWP. The estimated daily exposure to TRWP ranged from 0.079 to 0.147 µg/m3, resulting in a margin of exposure for TRWP ranging from approximately 400 to 700. Though there remain uncertainties in the risk assessment stemming from both the hazard and exposure assessments, the current weight of evidence suggests that TRWP presents a low risk to human health.},

Driving conditions and formulation of materials have a decisive impact on the character of brake wear emissions. Released wear particles settle on roads or vehicle hardware, but a considerable fraction is airborne. Due to high-energy conditions and complex mechanochemical interactions, various newly formed species originate. Brake pads are multicomponent materials, and manufacturers use a high number of different materials. These materials can be in conformation with environmental requirements (see Chapter 5); however, significant changes in chemistry and structure of the newly formed wear particles are observed. Numerous studies use different procedures to generate, measure, and characterize wear particles. Emissions of micrometric, submicron, and nanosized particles containing metals, elemental carbon, and organic carbon were observed. Because there is still no recommended practice by governmental agencies for estimation of brake wear emissions, there are plenty of issues to be addressed in future.},

Measurements were carried out during morning, off- and evening-peak hours under windows-open and windows-closed (fan-on and recirculation) conditions on predefined routes. For all cities, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were highest during windows-open, followed by fan-on and recirculation. Compared with recirculation, PM2.5 and PM10 were higher by up to 589{\%} (Blantyre) and 1020{\%} (S{\~{a}}o Paulo), during windows-open and higher by up to 385{\%} (S{\~{a}}o Paulo) and 390{\%} (S{\~{a}}o Paulo) during fan-on, respectively. Coarse particles dominated the PM fraction during windows-open while fine particles dominated during fan-on and recirculation, indicating filter effectiveness in removing coarse particles and a need for filters that limit the ingress of fine particles. Spatial variation analysis during windows-open showed that pollution hotspots make up to a third of the total route-length. PM2.5 exposure for windows-open during off-peak hours was 91{\%} and 40{\%} less than morning and evening peak hours, respectively. Across cities, determinants of relatively high personal exposure doses included lower car speeds, temporally longer journeys, and higher in-car concentrations. It was also concluded that car-users in the least affluent cities experienced disproportionately higher in-car PM2.5 exposures. Cities were classified into three groups according to low, intermediate and high levels of PM exposure to car commuters, allowing to draw similarities and highlight best practices.},

This study was aimed to assess the hotspots of vehicle-generated particulate matter ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10) at defined drop-off/pick-up points and its ingress into a nearby naturally ventilated primary school classroom. Five different locations were selected inside school premises for measurements during two peak hours: morning (MP; 0730-0930 h; local time), evening (EP; 1400-1600 h), and off-peak (OP; 1100-1300 h) hours for comparison. These represent PM measurements at the main road, pick-up point at the adjoining road, drop-off point, a classroom, and the school playground. Additional measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) were taken simultaneously inside and outside (drop-off point) the classroom to understand its build-up and ingress of outdoor PM. The results demonstrated nearly a three-fold increase in the concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) during drop-off hours compared to off-peak hours indicated the dominant contribution of car queuing in the school premises. Coarse particles (PM2.5–10) were prevalent in the school playground, while the contribution of fine particles as a result of traffic congestion became more pronounced during drop-off hours. In the naturally ventilated classroom, the changes in indoor PM2.5 concentrations during both peak hours (0.58 {\textless} R2 {\textless} 0.67) were followed by the outdoor concentration at the drop-off point. This initiative resulted in valuable information that might be used to influence school commuting style and raise other important issues such as the generally fairly high PM2.5 concentrations in the playground and future classroom ventilation plans.},

abstract = {Universal kriging is applied to the command area of a set of canal irrigation projects in northwestern India to show its applicability for optimal contour mapping of groundwater levels. This command area faces the problem of a rising groundwater table and manifestation of waterlogging over the years at many places. With the use of measured elevations of the water table in September 1990 at 143 observation sites in an area of 4500 km2, an omni-directional experimental semivariogram was constructed. The concave upward shape of omni-directional experimental semivariogram indicated the non-stationarity of the data and so the need for universal kriging. Directional semivariograms were calculated to find out the direction along which there is least drift. This directional semivariogram was considered as the underlying semivariogram and various theoretical semivariogram models were fitted to it. The drift order was estimated from the cross-validation procedure. The model and drift order finally selected were used to estimate the groundwater levels and corresponding estimation variances at the nodes of a square grid of 2 km × 2 km, and to develop the corresponding contour map.

abstract = {We investigated the physical and chemical properties of non-exhaust coarse and fine particles generated by on-road driving and in a laboratory setting using a mobile sampling system. The on-road driving and laboratory measurements performed under constant speed driving revealed that particles produced by tire wear had a size distribution in the range of 2-3. $\mu$m, while roadway particles (RWPs) measured behind the front tire during on-road driving largely comprised crustal materials such as road surface wear particles and road dust as well as tire wear particles (TWPs). The mode diameters of particles obtained from on-road driving under cornering conditions were similar to those obtained under constant speed conditions, but with higher concentrations of crustal elements. Under braking conditions, the particulate matter (PM) concentrations of brake wear particles (BWPs) sampled near the brake pad increased significantly and were much higher than the concentration of RWPs during deceleration, indicating that BWPs are one of the main sources of non-exhaust emissions. In addition, BWPs observed from on-road and laboratory measurements had a broader PM size range (1-10. $\mu$m) than RWPs. Size-segregated chemical analysis of PM samples indicated that the concentrations of Fe and Ca were highest in the coarse fraction emitted under constant speed and cornering conditions, while Fe, Ba, and Ti were most abundant in the fine fraction emitted during braking events. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Given that around eight million commuters use the Seoul Metropolitan Subway (SMS) each day, the indoor air quality (IAQ) of its stations has attracted much public attention. We have monitored the concentration of particulate matters (PMx) (i.e., PM10, PM2.5, and PM1) in six major transfer stations per minute for three weeks during the summer, autumn, and winter in 2014 and 2015. The data were analyzed to investigate the relationship between PMx concentration and multivariate environmental factors using statistical methods. The average PM concentration observed was approximately two or three times higher than outdoor PM10 concentration, showing similar temporal patterns at concourses and platforms. This implies that outdoor PM10 is the most significant factor in controlling indoor PM concentration. In addition, the station depth and number of trains passing through stations were found to be additional influences on PMx. Principal component analysis (PCA) and self-organizing map (SOM) were employed, through which we found that the number of trains influences PM concentration in the vicinity of platforms only, and PMx hotspots were determined. This study identifies the external and internal factors affecting PMx characteristics in six SMS stations, which can assist in the development of effective IAQ management plans to improve public health.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We present a review of emerging technologies and how these can transform personal air pollution exposure assessment and subsequent health research. RECENT FINDINGS: Estimating personal air pollution exposures is currently split broadly into methods for modeling exposures for large populations versus measuring exposures for small populations. Air pollution sensors, smartphones, and air pollution models capitalizing on big/new data sources offer tremendous opportunity for unifying these approaches and improving long-term personal exposure prediction at scales needed for population-based research. A multi-disciplinary approach is needed to combine these technologies to not only estimate personal exposures for epidemiological research but also determine drivers of these exposures and new prevention opportunities. While available technologies can revolutionize air pollution exposure research, ethical, privacy, logistical, and data science challenges must be met before widespread implementations occur. Available technologies and related advances in data science can improve long-term personal air pollution exposure estimates at scales needed for population-based research. This will advance our ability to evaluate the impacts of air pollution on human health and develop effective prevention strategies.},

abstract = {In many areas of the world, concentrations of ambient air pollutants exceed levels associated with increased risk of acute and chronic health problems. While effective policies to reduce emissions at their sources are clearly preferable, some evidence supports the effectiveness of individual actions to reduce exposure and health risks. Personal exposure to ambient air pollution can be reduced on high air pollution days by staying indoors, reducing outdoor air infiltration to indoors, cleaning indoor air with air filters, and limiting physical exertion, especially outdoors and near air pollution sources. Limited evidence suggests that the use of respirators may be effective in some circumstances. Awareness of air pollution levels is facilitated by a growing number of public air quality alert systems. Avoiding exposure to air pollutants is especially important for susceptible individuals with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, children, and the elderly. Research on mechanisms underlying the adverse health effects of air pollution have suggested potential pharmaceutical or chemopreventive interventions, such as antioxidant or antithrombotic agents, but in the absence of data on health outcomes, no sound recommendations can be made for primary prevention. Health care providers and their patients should carefully consider individual circumstances related to outdoor and indoor air pollutant exposure levels and susceptibility to those air pollutants when deciding on a course of action to reduce personal exposure and health risks from ambient air pollutants. Careful consideration is especially warranted when interventions may have unintended negative consequences, such as when efforts to avoid exposure to air pollutants lead to reduced physical activity or when there is evidence that dietary supplements, such as antioxidants, have potential adverse health effects. These potential complications of partially effective personal interventions to reduce exposure or risk highlight the primary importance of reducing emissions of air pollutants at their sources.},

Good correlation was observed between Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Sb and change in traffic volume. The concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organics varies significantly at the entrance and exit site of the tunnel, with fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, chrysene and benzothiazole having the highest incremented concentrations. The application of Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression Analysis helped to identify the emission sources for 82{\%} of the total PM10 mass inside the tunnel. Identified sources include resuspension (27{\%}), diesel exhaust emissions (21{\%}), petrol exhaust emissions (12{\%}), brake wear emissions (11{\%}) and road surface wear (11{\%}). This study shows that major health related chemical species of PM10 originate from non-exhaust sources, further signifying the need for legislation to reduce these emissions.},

For this purpose, 24-hr integrated PM 2.5 samples were collected and analyzed for ionic species. Hourly average PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations from OPS were 2.7 and 1.7 times higher than those from GRIMM OPC, respectively, and also 1.9 and 1.7 times higher than those from beta-ray absorption method (BAM). However, highest PM 2.5 /PM 10 value was found in GRIMM OPC. The PM 2.5 /PM 10 was 0.85±0.09, 0.50±0.20, and 0.53±0.17 for OPC, OPS, and BAM, respectively, indicating rather underestimation of PM 10 from GRIMM OPC. 24-hr average PM 2.5 from OPC and OPS was approximately 3{\%} (an intercept of +9.3 {\$}\mu{\$}g/m 3) lower and 63{\%} (an intercept of +3.3 {\$}\mu{\$}g/m 3) higher than that from the gravimetric method, respectively, with R 2 values of 0.93 and 0.82. However, 24-hr average PM 2.5 from BAM was strongly correlated with the gravimetric method with a slope of 0.96, an intercept of 3.4 {\$}\mu{\$}g/m 3 , and an R 2 of 0.97, suggesting high reliability of BAM. Also the difference in 24-hr PM 2.5 between gravimetric method and OPS increased negatively with increasing the concentrations of secondary inorganic components (= NO 3-+ NH 4 + + SO 4 2-), NO 3-, NH 4 + , and SO 4 2-However, secondary ionic species concentrations were very poorly correlated (R 2 ={\~{}}0.00) with the difference in 24-hr PM 2.5 between the gravimetric method and GRIMM OPC, suggesting GRIMM dust monitor provides a reliable and real-time measurements of PM 2.5. Finally, results from this study indicates that PM 10 and PM 2.5 from TSI OPS and PM 10 from GRIMM OPC should be corrected to obtain their real concentrations based on the gravimetric method and/or BAM.},

abstract = {Land use regression (LUR) is a common method of predicting spatial variability of air pollution to estimate exposure. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitric oxide (NO), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and black carbon (BC) concentrations were measured during two sampling campaigns (April–May and November–January) in Hong Kong (a prototypical high-density high-rise city). Along with 365 potential geospatial predictor variables, these concentrations were used to build two-dimensional land use regression (LUR) models for the territory. Summary statistics for combined measurements over both campaigns were: a) NO2 (Mean=106$\mu$g/m3, SD=38.5, N=95), b) NO (M=147$\mu$g/m3, SD=88.9, N=40), c) PM2.5 (M=35$\mu$g/m3, SD=6.3, N=64), and BC (M=10.6$\mu$g/m3, SD=5.3, N=76). Final LUR models had the following statistics: a) NO2 (R2=0.46, RMSE=28$\mu$g/m3) b) NO (R2=0.50, RMSE=62$\mu$g/m3), c) PM2.5 (R2=0.59; RMSE=4$\mu$g/m3), and d) BC (R2=0.50, RMSE=4$\mu$g/m3). Traditional LUR predictors such as road length, car park density, and land use types were included in most models. The NO2 prediction surface values were highest in Kowloon and the northern region of Hong Kong Island (downtown Hong Kong). NO showed a similar pattern in the built-up region. Both PM2.5 and BC predictions exhibited a northwest-southeast gradient, with higher concentrations in the north (close to mainland China). For BC, the port was also an area of elevated predicted concentrations. The results matched with existing literature on spatial variation in concentrations of air pollutants and in relation to important emission sources in Hong Kong. The success of these models suggests LUR is appropriate in high-density, high-rise cities.},

abstract = {Spatially continuous data of environmental variables are often required for environmental sciences and management. However, information for environmental variables is usually collected by point sampling, particularly for the mountainous region and deep ocean area. Thus, methods generating such spatially continuous data by using point samples become essential tools. Spatial interpolation methods (SIMs) are, however, often data-specific or even variable-specific. Many factors affect the predictive performance of the methods and previous studies have shown that their effects are not consistent. Hence it is difficult to select an appropriate method for a given dataset. This review aims to provide guidelines and suggestions regarding application of SIMs to environmental data by comparing the features of the commonly applied methods which fall into three categories, namely: non-geostatistical interpolation methods, geostatistical interpolation methods and combined methods. Factors affecting the performance, including sampling design, sample spatial distribution, data quality, correlation between primary and secondary variables, and interaction among factors, are discussed. A total of 25 commonly applied methods are then classified based on their features to provide an overview of the relationships among them. These features are quantified and then clustered to show similarities among these 25 methods. An easy to use decision tree for selecting an appropriate method from these 25 methods is developed based on data availability, data nature, expected estimation, and features of the method. Finally, a list of software packages for spatial interpolation is provided.},

abstract = {Land-use regression (LUR) models have been developed to estimate spatial distributions of traffic-related pollutants. Several studies have examined spatial autocorrelation among residuals in LUR models, but few utilized spatial residual information in model prediction, or examined the impact of modeling methods, monitoring site selection, or traffic data quality on LUR performance. This study aims to improve spatial models for traffic-related pollutants using generalized additive models (GAM) combined with cokriging of spatial residuals. Specifically, we developed spatial models for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NO x) concentrations in Southern California separately for two seasons (summer and winter) based on over 240 sampling locations. Pollutant concentrations were disaggregated into three components: local means, spatial residuals, and normal random residuals. Local means were modeled by GAM. Spatial residuals were cokriged with global residuals at nearby sampling locations that were spatially auto-correlated. We compared this two-stage approach with four commonly-used spatial models: universal kriging, multiple linear LUR and GAM with and without a spatial smoothing term. Leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for model validation and comparison purposes. The results show that our GAM plus cokriging models predicted summer and winter NO 2 and NO x concentration surfaces well, with cross validation R 2 values ranging from 0.88 to 0.92. While local covariates accounted for partial variance of the measured NO 2 and NO x concentrations, spatial autocorrelation accounted for about 20{\%} of the variance. Our spatial GAM model improved R 2 considerably compared to the other four approaches. Conclusively, our two-stage model captured summer and winter differences in NO 2 and NO x spatial distributions in Southern California well. When sampling location selection cannot be optimized for the intended model and fewer covariates are available as predictors for the model, the two-stage model is more robust compared to multiple linear regression models. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Traffic-related air pollution has been associated with various health risks for human populations living near roadways. Understanding the relationship between traffic density and dispersion of vehicle-released air pollutants is important for assessing human exposure to near-road air pollutants. We performed a literature survey targeting publications containing measurement data of traffic-related air pollutants near roads with distance information on their concentration distribution. Concentration decay rates over down-wind distance away from major roads were calculated for black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NO2 or NOx) and meta-data analysis on these rates was performed. These analyses showed metadata-based exponential decay rates of 0.0026, 0.0019, 0.0004, and 0.0027 m−1 for BC, CO, NO2 and NOx, respectively. Using these measurement data-based decay rates, concentrations for BC, CO, NO2 and NOx over various near-road distances were predicted. These results are useful for enhancing exposure modeling and thus more reliably assessing the health risk of exposure to near road air pollution.},

abstract = {There is substantial evidence to indicate that route choice in urban areas is complex cognitive process, conducted under uncertainty and formed on partial perspectives. Yet, conventional route choice models continue make simplistic assumptions around the nature of human cognitive ability, memory and preference. In this paper, a novel framework for route choice in urban areas is introduced, aiming to more accurately reflect the uncertain, bounded nature of route choice decision making. Two main advances are introduced. The first involves the definition of a hierarchical model of space representing the relationship between urban features and human cognition, combining findings from both the extensive previous literature on spatial cognition and a large route choice dataset. The second advance involves the development of heuristic rules for route choice decisions, building upon the hierarchical model of urban space. The heuristics describe the process by which quick, ‘good enough' decisions are made when individuals are faced with uncertainty. This element of the model is once more constructed and parameterised according to findings from prior research and the trends identified within a large routing dataset. The paper outlines the implementation of the framework within a real-world context, validating the results against observed behaviours. Conclusions are offered as to the extension and improvement of this approach, outlining its potential as an alternative to other route choice modelling frameworks.},

abstract = {Environmental quality in public rail transit has recently raised great concern, with more attention paid to underground subway microenvironment. This research aimed to provide guidance for healthy urban subway microenvironments (sub-MEs) according to comprehensive micro-environmental categories, including thermal environment, air quality, lighting environment, and acoustic environment from both practical and regulation perspectives. Field sampling experiments were conducted in Nanjing Metro Line X (NMLX). Descriptive analysis, correlation analysis and one-way analysis of variance were used to investigate the status quo of urban sub-MEs. A paired samples t-test was then performed to compare among subway station halls, platforms, and in-cabin trains based on integrated sub-MEs. Results show that relative humidity, air velocity, respirable particulate matter (PM(10)) concentration, and illuminance dissatisfy the requirements in relevant national standards. Significant difference was observed in lighting environment between station hall and platform. It was detected platforms are warmer and more polluted than train cabins. Additionally, subway trains generate main noise on platform which is much louder when leaving than arriving. Protective strategies for sub-ME improvement as well as principles for updating standards were proposed from a proactive point of view. The findings are beneficial for moving towards healthy urban sub-MEs and more sustainable operation of subway systems.},

We study the relationships between ambient concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2). The variation of the level of oxidant (OX=O3+NO2) with the NOx is obtained. It can be seen that the level of OX at a given location is made up of two contributions: one independent and another dependent on the NOx concentration. The first one can be considered as a regional contribution, equivalent to the background O3 concentration and the second one as a local contribution that depends on the level of primary pollution. Local oxidant sources may include direct NO2 emissions, the reaction of NO with O2 at high-NOx levels, and the emission of species that promote the conversion of NO to NO2. The final category of emissions may include the nitrous acid (HONO) that is emitted directly in vehicle exhaust. Finally, we present a diurnal variation of the local as well as regional contributions and the dependence of the last one on wind direction.},

These studies have typically assessed TRAP exposure using traffic measures, such as distance to major roads, or by modeling air pollutant concentrations; however inconsistent associations with pediatric allergic diseases have often been found. Using road proximity and density, we previously found an association between TRAP and atopic eczema among approximately 15,000 children living in Seoul, Korea, heavily populated and highly polluted city in which traffic is a major emission source. We aimed to conduct a parallel analysis using modeled air pollution concentrations and thus examine the consistency of the association. Specifically, we examined the associations of individual-level annual-average concentrations of NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 with symptoms and diagnoses of three pediatric allergic diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic eczema.},

abstract = {Vehicle interior air quality (VIAQ) was investigated inside 14 diesel/non-diesel taxi pairs operating simultaneously and under normal working conditions over six weekday hours (10.00–16.00) in the city of Barcelona, Spain. Parameters measured included PM10 mass and inorganic chemistry, ultrafine particle number (N) and size, lung surface deposited area (LDSA), black carbon (BC), CO2, CO, and a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Most taxi drivers elected to drive with windows open, thus keeping levels of CO2 and internally-generated VOCs low but exposing them to high levels of traffic-related air pollutants entering from outside and confirming that air exchange rates are the dominant influence on VIAQ. Median values of N and LDSA (both sensitive markers of VIAQ fluctuations and likely health effects) were reduced to around 104 {\#}/cm3 and {\textless} 20 µm2/cm3 respectively under closed conditions, but more than doubled with windows open and sometimes approached 105 {\#}/cm3 and 240 µm2/cm3. In exceptional traffic conditions, transient pollution peaks caused by outside infiltration exceeded N = 106 {\#}/cm3 and LDSA= 1000 µm2/cm3. Indications of self-pollution were implicated by higher BC and CO levels, and larger UFP sizes, measured inside diesel taxis as compared to their non-diesel pair, and the highest concentrations of CO ({\textgreater}2 ppm) were commonly associated with older, high-km diesel taxis. Median PM10 concentrations (67 µg/m3) were treble those of urban background, mainly due to increased levels of organic and elemental carbon, with source apportionment calculations identifying the main pollutants as vehicle exhaust and non-exhaust particles. Enhancements in PM10 concentrations of Cr, Cu, Sn, Sb, and a “High Field Strength Element” zircon-related group characterised by Zr, Hf, Nb, Y and U, are attributed mainly to the presence of brake-derived PM. Volatile organic compounds display a mixture which reflects the complexity of traffic-related organic carbon emissions infiltrating the taxi interior, with 2-methylbutane and n-pentane being the most abundant VOCs, followed by toluene, m-xylene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene, benzene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Internally sourced VOCs included high monoterpene concentrations from an air freshener, and interior off-gassing may explain why the youngest taxi registered the highest content of alkanes and aromatic compounds. Carbon dioxide concentrations quickly climbed to undesirable levels ({\textgreater}2500 ppm) under closed ventilation conditions and could stay high for much of the working day. Taxi drivers face daily occupational exposure to traffic-related air pollutants and would benefit from a greater awareness of VIAQ issues, notably the use of ventilation, to encourage them to minimise possible health effects caused by their working environment.},

abstract = {In search of sensitive screening parameters for assessing acute effects of ambient air pollutants in young schoolchildren, the impact of 8-h average air pollution before lung function testing was investigated by oscillatory measurements of resistance and spirometry with flow–volume loops. At a central elementary school in Linz, the capital of Upper Austria, 163 children aged 7–10 yrs underwent repeated examinations at the same time of day during 1 school year, yielding a total of 11–12 lung function tests per child. Associations to mass concentrations of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured continuously at a nearby monitoring station were tested, applying the Generalised Estimating Equations model. Reductions per 10 µg{\textperiodcentered}m−3 (both for particles and for NO2) were in the magnitude of 1{\%} for most lung function parameters. The most sensitive indicator for acute effects of combustion-related pollutants was a change in maximal expiratory flow in small airways. NO2 at concentrations below current standards reduced (in the multipollutant model) the forced expiratory volume in one second by 1.01{\%}, maximal instantaneous forced flow when 50{\%} of the forced vital capacity remains to be exhaled (MEF50{\%}) by 1.99{\%} and MEF25{\%} by 1.96{\%}. Peripheral resistance increased by 1.03{\%} per 10 µg{\textperiodcentered}m−3 of particulate matter with a 50{\%} cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5). Resistance is less influenced by the child{\&}{\#}039;s cooperation and should be utilised more often in environmental epidemiology when screening for early signs of small airway dysfunction from urban air pollution, but cannot replace the measurement of MEF50{\%} and MEF25{\%}. In the basic model, the reduction of these parameters per 10 µg{\textperiodcentered}m−3 was highest for NO2, followed by PM1, PM2.5 and PM10, while exposure to coarse dust (PM10–PM2.5) did not change end-expiratory flow significantly. All acute effects of urban air pollution found on the lung function of healthy pupils were evident at levels below current European limit values for nitrogen dioxide. Thus, planned reduction of nitrogen dioxide emission (Euro 5; vehicles that comply with the emission limits as defined in Directive 99/96/EC) of 20{\%} in 2010 would seem to be insufficient.},

abstract = {Air pollution in large urban areas has become a serious issue due to its negative impacts on human health, building materials, biodiversity and urban ecosystems in both developed and less-wealthy nations. In most large urban areas, especially in developed countries air quality monitoring networks (AQMN) have been established that provide air quality (AQ) data for various purposes, e.g., to monitor regulatory compliance and to assess the effectiveness of control strategies. However, the criteria of structuring the network are currently defined by single questions rather than attempting to create a network to serve multiple functions. Here we propose a methodology supported by numerical, conceptual and GIS frameworks for structuring AQMN using social, environmental and economic indicators as a case study in Sheffield, UK. The main factors used for air quality monitoring station (AQMS) selection are population-weighted pollution concentration (PWPC) and weighted spatial variability (WSV) incorporating population density (social indicator), pollution levels and spatial variability of air pollutant concentrations (environmental indicator). Total number of sensors is decided on the basis of budget (economic indicator), whereas the number of sensors deployed in each output area is proportional to WSV. The purpose of AQ monitoring and its role in determining the location of AQMS is analysed. Furthermore, the existing AQMN is analysed and an alternative proposed following a formal procedure. In contrast to traditional networks, which are structured based on a single AQ monitoring approach, the proposed AQMN has several layers of sensors: Reference sensors recommended by EU and DEFRA, low-cost sensors (LCS) (AQMesh and Envirowatch E-MOTEs) and IoT (Internet of Things) sensors. The core aim is to structure an integrated AQMN in urban areas, which will lead to the collection of AQ data with high spatiotemporal resolution. The use of LCS in the proposed network provides a cheaper option for setting up a purpose-designed network for greater spatial coverage, especially in low- and middle-income countries.},

abstract = {Estimating pollutant concentrations at a local and regional scale is essential in environmental and health policy decision making. Here we present a novel land use regression (LUR) modelling methodology that exploits the high temporal resolution of fixed-site monitoring (FSM) to produce a national-scale air quality model for the key pollutant NO2. The methodology partitions concentration time series from a national FSM network into wind-dependent sectors or “wedges”. A LUR model is derived using predictor variables calculated within the directional wind sectors, and compared against the long-term average concentrations within each sector. Validation results, based on 15 FSM training sites, show that the model captured 78{\%} of the spatial variability in NO2 across the Republic of Ireland. This compares favourably to traditional LUR models based on purpose-designed monitoring campaigns despite using approximately half the number of monitoring points. Results also demonstrate the value of incorporating the relative position of emission source and receptor into the empirical LUR model structure. We applied the model at a high-resolution across the Republic of Ireland to enable applications such as the study of environmental exposure and human health, assessing representativeness of air quality monitoring networks and informing environmental management and policy makers. While the study focuses on Ireland, the methodology also has potential applicability for other criteria pollutants where appropriate FSM and meteorological networks exist.},

abstract = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a way of representing complex systems of autonomous agents or actors, and of simulating the multiple potential outcomes of these agents' behaviors and interactions in the form of a range of alternatives or futures. Despite the complexity of the tourism system, and the power and flexibility of ABM to overcome the assumptions such as homogeneity, linearity, equilibrium, and rationality typical of traditional modeling techniques, ABM has received little attention from tourism researchers and practitioners. The purpose of this paper is to introduce ABM to a wider tourism audience. Specifically, the appropriateness of tourism as a phenomenon to be subjected to ABM is established; the power and benefits of ABM as an alternative scientific mechanism are illuminated; the few existing applications of ABM in the tourism arena are summarized; and, a range of potential applications in the areas of tourism planning, development, marketing and management is proposed.},

abstract = {Air pollution related to traffic emissions pose an especially significant problem in cities; this is due to its adverse impact on human health and well-being. Previous studies which have aimed to quantify emissions from the transportation sector have been limited by either simulated or coarsely resolved traffic volume data. Emissions inventories form the basis of urban pollution models, therefore in this study, Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data from a taxi fleet of over 15,000 vehicles were analyzed with the aim of predicting air pollution emissions for Singapore. This novel approach enabled the quantification of instantaneous drive cycle parameters in high spatio-temporal resolution, which provided the basis for a microscopic emissions model. Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) emissions were thus estimated. Highly localized areas of elevated emissions levels were identified, with a spatio-temporal precision not possible with previously used methods for estimating emissions. Relatively higher emissions areas were mainly concentrated in a few districts that were the Singapore Downtown Core area, to the north of the central urban region and to the east of it. Daily emissions quantified for the total motor vehicle population of Singapore were found to be comparable to another emissions dataset. Results demonstrated that high-resolution spatio-temporal vehicle traces detected using GPS in large taxi fleets could be used to infer highly localized areas of elevated acceleration and air pollution emissions in cities, and may become a complement to traditional emission estimates, especially in emerging cities and countries where reliable fine-grained urban air quality data is not easily available. This is the first study of its kind to investigate measured microscopic vehicle movement in tandem with microscopic emissions modeling for a substantial study domain.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the increasing levels of polluting emissions and fuel consumption of the road traffic in modern cities directly affect air quality, the city economy, and especially the health of citizens. Therefore, improving the efficiency of the traffic flow is a mandatory task in order to mitigate such critical problems. In this article, a Swarm Intelligence approach is proposed for the optimal scheduling of traffic lights timing programs in metropolitan areas. By doing so, the traffic flow of vehicles can be improved with the final goal global target of reducing their fuel consumption and gas emissions (CO and NOx). In this work we optimize the traffic lights timing programs and analyze their effect in pollution by following the standard HBEFA as the traffic emission model. Specifically, we focus on two large and heterogeneous urban scenarios located in the cities of Malaga and Seville (in Spain). When compared to the traffic lights timing programs designed by experts close to real ones, the proposed strategy obtains significant reductions in terms of the emission rates (23.3 {\%} CO and 29.3 {\%} NOx) and the total fuel consumption.},

abstract = {PM10 levels and its chemical composition were studied inside and outdoor of seven primary schools (3 in urban environment, 3 in industrial environment, 1 in rural environment) located in the Mediterranean coast in an area with an important industrial nucleus dedicated to the treatment of raw mineral materials. The main objective of this work is a comparison between these levels obtained inside and outside schools and also asses the influence of various natural and anthropogenic emission sources on particles concentrations found inside. The indoor airborne samples were collected using RespiCon TM. In the three outdoor sampling stations was used a minivol air sampler type 3.1 LVS of Derenda. PM10 Chemical composition was obtained by ICP-MS (elements) and ion chromatography The ratio I/O (indoor/outdoor) has been calculated taking into account only the samples taken in the same conditions. In all schools the ratio I/O for PM10 was greater than unity (between 1.3 and 7.8), indicating that existed significant indoor sources of these particles. In the three schools located in the industrial environment were collected PM10 samples inside and outside in non-teaching periods. Comparing the values of I/O when the classrooms were unoccupied with respect to the average value of these same schools when the classrooms are occupied, the behaviour is different depending on the location. On the other hand, a sample in an industrial school was obtained when some infrastructure works were being carried out outside of school. This caused a significant increase in the concentration of particles in the interior (I/O = 19.9). From the levels of As, Ni, Cd, Pb, Al, B, Zn, Mg, Sb, F−, ClO2-, NO3- and SO42- in PM10 inside and outside of each school, also the ratios I/O were calculated. These chemical ratios I/O were higher than unity in all cases and generally higher than those recorded in the case of PM10. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between the elements and anions and the PM10, and between the different elements and anions were calculated for the purpose of establishing the existence of common emission sources.},

abstract = {In this study, the fundamental aspects governing the environmental behavior of nitrogen oxides were explored from two air quality-monitoring stations (AQM) in Seoul, Korea, over an 11-year period (1996–2006). The two stations were selected to represent an urban roadside (U-RS) and urban background station (U-BG). The mean concentration levels of NOx at the U-RS area exhibited a gradual decrease through years (from ∼290ppb (1996) to 100ppb (2003)), while those measured at the U-BG site maintained fairly stable values (∼70ppb) throughout the years. The mean concentration levels of NO and NO2 at the U-BG site were almost the same (∼35ppb), while the U-RS site showed that the mean value of NO (∼127ppb) is significantly higher than that of NO2 (∼60ppb). The observation of larger differences in NO level between the two sites reflects the direct impact of vehicular emissions at the U-RS site. Both correlation and factor analyses were conducted between the hourly data sets of NOx species (N=∼90,000) and relevant environmental variables for both the sites. The results of both tests confirm the prominent role of vehicular activities in determining the level of nitrogen oxides at urban roadside environments, although such effects appear to be rather intricate at U-BG. Our comparative analysis of NOx data sets collected over varying temporal scales indicate that their distributions in the urban environment can be distinguished more clearly in spatial factors (i.e., between urban background and urban roadside) than other criteria.},

Covariates used in the interpolation include remote sensing derived elevation, aspect, canopy height, percent forest cover and MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST). Because of missing values, we aggregated daily LST values as long term (2000-2010) monthly climatologies to leverage its spatial detail in the interpolation. We predicted temperature with three methods-Universal Kriging, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM)-and assessed predictions using meteorological stations over 365 days in 2010. We find that GAM is least sensitive to overtraining (overfitting) and results in lowest errors in term of distance to closest training stations. Mean elevation, LST, and distance to ocean are flagged most frequently as significant covariates among all daily predictions. Results indicate that GAM with latitude, longitude and elevation is the top model but that LST has potential in providing additional fine-grained spatial structure related to land cover effects. The study also highlights the need for more rigorous methods and data to evaluate the spatial structure and fine grained accuracy of predicted surfaces.},

Objectives
Although several environmental factors contribute to the etiology of late-life depressive symptoms, the role of ambient air pollution has been understudied. Experimental data support the neurotoxicity of airborne particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), but it remains unclear whether long-term exposure is associated with late-life depressive symptoms. Our secondary aim was to explore whether the observed associations between exposure and depressive symptoms are explained by dementia risk.
Design, Setting, and Participants
Prospective community-dwelling cohort study from the Women's Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging (1999–2010). Our analyses included 1,989 older women (baseline age 73.3 ± 3.75) with no prior depression or cognitive impairment.
Measurements
Participants completed annual assessments of depressive symptoms (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale). Average ambient PM2.5 exposure at the residential location was estimated by spatiotemporal modeling for the 3-years preceding each neuropsychological assessment. Participants underwent separate annual examinations for incident dementia defined by DSM-IV. Latent-class mixture models examined the association between PM2.5 and identified trajectories of symptoms.
Results
Six trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified. Across all women, PM2.5 exposure was positively associated with depressive symptoms. The effect was especially strong in two clusters with sustained depressive symptoms (n = 625 sustained-mild [31{\%}]; n = 125 sustained-moderate; [6{\%}]). Among those with sustained-moderate symptoms, the estimated adverse effect of PM2.5 exposure was greater than that of hypertension. Among women without dementia, associations were modestly attenuated.
Conclusion

abstract = {NetLogo has become a standard platform for agent-based simulation, yet there appears to be widespread belief that it is not suitable for large and complex models due to slow execution. Our experience does not support that belief. NetLogo programs often do run very slowly when written to minimize code length and maximize clarity, but relatively simple and easily tested changes can almost always produce major increases in execution speed. We recommend a five-step process for quantifying execution speed, identifying slow parts of code, and writing faster code. Avoiding or improving agent filtering statements can often produce dramatic speed improvements. For models with extensive initialization methods, reorganizing the setup procedure can reduce the initialization effort in simulation experiments. Programming the same behavior in a different way can sometimes provide order-of-magnitude speed increases. For models in which most agents do nothing on most time steps, discrete event simulation—facilitated by the time extension to NetLogo—can dramatically increase speed. NetLogo's BehaviorSpace tool makes it very easy to conduct multiple-model-run experiments in parallel on either desktop or high performance cluster computers, so even quite slow models can be executed thousands of times. NetLogo also is supported by efficient analysis tools, such as BehaviorSearch and RNetLogo, that can reduce the number of model runs and the effort to set them up for (e.g.) parameterization and sensitivity analysis.},

abstract = {Emissions of air pollutants such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides and particulates have significant health impacts as well as effects on natural and anthropogenic ecosystems. These same emissions also can change atmospheric chemistry and the planetary energy balance, thereby impacting global and regional climate. Long-term scenarios for air pollutant emissions are needed as inputs to global climate and chemistry models, and for analysis linking air pollutant impacts across sectors. In this paper we present methodology and results for air pollutant emissions in Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios. We first present a set of three air pollution narratives that describe high, central, and low pollution control ambitions over the 21st century. These narratives are then translated into quantitative guidance for use in integrated assessment models. The resulting pollutant emission trajectories under the SSP scenarios cover a wider range than the scenarios used in previous international climate model comparisons. In the SSP3 and SSP4 scenarios, where economic, institutional and technological limitations slow air quality improvements, global pollutant emissions over the 21st century can be comparable to current levels. Pollutant emissions in the SSP1 scenarios fall to low levels due to the assumption of technological advances and successful global action to control emissions.},

abstract = {An extensive body of research has demonstrated that air pollution exposure is associated with adverse health outcomes. Urban air quality remains a major concern for both public health officials and the general public. In the United States, air quality public awareness campaigns are major efforts of governments at every level. Yet, our understanding of relationships between ambient air pollution exposure, public perceptions of air quality, and concerns about associated health risks is incomplete. We examined 2869 individual responses to annual air quality public awareness surveys administered between 2009 and 2012 in the Kansas City metropolitan area. Our study had three objectives: 1) examine the spatial distribution of PM2.5 and O3 exposures, pollution perceptions, and pollution health concerns; 2) explore relationships between individual- and area-level characteristics and PM2.5 and O3 exposure; 3) and examine cross-sectional associations between individual- and area-level characteristics, as well as PM2.5 and O3 exposures, and pollution perception and pollution health concerns. We found inverse spatial patterns between the distribution of O3 and PM2.5 exposure levels as well as between areas where respondents perceived air pollution as worsening and areas where residents had higher concern about the health effects of pollution exposure. We also found inverse relationships between individual- and area-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and O3 and PM2.5 exposure. Individual-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution perceptions, while both individual- and area-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution health concerns. Public awareness campaigns should be combined with education on ways the public can protect themselves and tailored explicitly for targeting vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, and persons with respiratory problems) and areas both socioeconomically vulnerable (e.g., higher racial segregation and poverty) and experiencing higher pollution exposure (e.g., O3 and PM2.5).},

We compared the exposure to particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10), Black Carbon (BC) and ultrafine particles (PNCs; 0.02–1$\mu$m) for typical commutes by car, bus and underground from 4 London areas with different levels of income deprivation (G1 to G4, from most to least deprived). The highest BC and PM concentrations were found in G1 while the highest PNC in G3. Lowest concentrations for all pollutants were observed in G2. We found no systematic relationship between income deprivation and pollutant concentrations, suggesting that differences between transport modes are a stronger influence. The underground showed the highest PM concentrations, followed by buses and a much lower concentrations in cars. BC concentrations in the underground were overestimated due to Fe interference. BC concentrations were also higher in buses than cars because of a lower infiltration of outside pollutants into the car cabin. PNCs were highest in buses, closely followed by cars, but lowest in underground due to the absence of combustion sources. Concentration in the road modes (car and bus) were governed by the traffic conditions (such as traffic flow interruptions) at the specific road section. Exposures were reduced in trains with non-openable windows compared to those with openable windows. People from less income-deprived areas have a predominant use of car, receiving the lowest doses (RDD{\textless}1$\mu$gh−1) during commute but generating the largest emissions per commuter. Conversely, commuters from high income-deprived areas have a major reliance on the bus, receiving higher exposures (RDD between 1.52 and 3.49$\mu$gh−1) while generating less emission per person. These findings suggest an aspect of environmental injustice and a need to incorporate the socioeconomic dimension in life-course exposure assessments.},

abstract = {Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ground–level ozone (O3) were measured and meteorological parameters, wind speed, temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure were monitored, to determine the seasonal variations of gas–phase pollutants in the Meadowlands. O3 and NOx were inversely related; the highest average NOx concentration (29ppb) occurred in winter while average O3 concentrations peaked in summer up to 36.2ppb. The seasonal variations of O3 were more distinct than NOx. In multiple linear and principal component regression analysis, ambient levels of NO2 and O3 were influenced primarily by wind speed. In time series and regression analysis, NO2 and O3 displayed an inverse relationship with wind speed but O3 paradoxically increased with wind speed downwind. The seasonality of O3 was amplified mainly by wind speed and temperature, while NOx displayed stronger dependence on diurnal source emissions. Concentrations of NOx and O3 were also influenced by differences in chemical processing through their complex emission–production and consumption mechanisms, making them interdependent. In intense solar radiation, O3 was NOx–dependent but as O3 levels were inhibited by lower temperatures, NOx concentrations increased. Higher O3 on weekends indicated an apparent sensitivity to VOC precursors. This study provides a basis for improved air quality standards primarily in summer and during daily O3 peaks. Additionally, plans for protection against health problems caused by O3 and NOX are feasible in this region.},

The complexity of cooperative ITS systems and the interrelation between its components requires their extensive testing before deployment. The lack of simulation platforms capable to test, with high modelling accuracy, cooperative ITS systems and applications in large scale scenarios triggered the implementation of the EU-funded iTETRIS simulation platform. iTETRIS is a unique open source simulation platform characterized by a modular architecture that allows integrating two widely adopted traffic and wireless simulators, while supporting the implementation of cooperative ITS applications in a language-agnostic fashion. This paper presents in detail the iTETRIS simulation platform, and describes its architecture, standard compliant implementation, operation and new functionalities. Finally, the paper demonstrates iTETRIS large scale cooperative ITS evaluation capabilities through the implementation and evaluation of cooperative traffic congestion detection and bus lane management applications. The detailed description and implemented examples provide valuable information on how to use and exploit iTETRIS simulation potential. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Agent-based models find wide application in all fields of science where large-scale patterns emerge from properties of individuals. Due to increasing capacities of computing resources it was possible to improve the level of detail and structural realism of next-generation models in recent years. However, this is at the expense of increased model complexity, which requires more efficient tools for model exploration, analysis and documentation that enable reproducibility, repeatability and parallelization. NetLogo is a widely used environment for agent-based model development, but it does not provide sufficient built-in tools for extensive model exploration, such as sensitivity analyses. One tool for controlling NetLogo externally is the r-package RNetLogo. However, this package is not suited for efficient, reproducible research as it has stability and resource allocation issues, is not straightforward to be setup and used on high performance computing clusters and does not provide utilities, such as storing and exchanging metadata, in an easy way. We present the r-package nlrx, which overcomes stability and resource allocation issues by running NetLogo simulations via dynamically created XML experiment files. Class objects make setting up experiments more convenient and helper functions provide many parameter exploration approaches, such as Latin Hypercube designs, Sobol sensitivity analyses or optimization approaches. Output is automatically collected in user-friendly formats and can be post-processed with provided utility functions. nlrx enables reproducibility by storing all relevant information and simulation output of experiments in one r object which can conveniently be archived and shared. We provide a detailed description of the nlrx package functions and the overall workflow. We also present a use case scenario using a NetLogo model, for which we performed a sensitivity analysis and a genetic algorithm optimization. The nlrx package is the first framework for documentation and application of reproducible NetLogo simulation model analysis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is evidence of adverse associations between short-term exposure to traffic-related pollution and health, but little is known about the relative contribution of the various sources and particulate constituents. METHODS: For each day for 2011-2012 in London, UK over 100 air pollutant metrics were assembled using monitors, modelling and chemical analyses. We selected a priori metrics indicative of traffic sources: general traffic, petrol exhaust, diesel exhaust and non-exhaust (mineral dust, brake and tyre wear). Using Poisson regression models, controlling for time-varying confounders, we derived effect estimates for cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions at prespecified lags and evaluated the sensitivity of estimates to multipollutant modelling and effect modification by season. RESULTS: For single day exposure, we found consistent associations between adult (15-64 years) cardiovascular and paediatric (0-14 years) respiratory admissions with elemental and black carbon (EC/BC), ranging from 0.56{\%} to 1.65{\%} increase per IQR change, and to a lesser degree with carbon monoxide (CO) and aluminium (Al). The average of past 7 days EC/BC exposure was associated with elderly (65+ years) cardiovascular admissions. Indicated associations were higher during the warm period of the year. Although effect estimates were sensitive to the adjustment for other pollutants they remained consistent in direction, indicating independence of associations from different sources, especially between diesel and petrol engines, as well as mineral dust. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exhaust related pollutants are associated with increased numbers of adult cardiovascular and paediatric respiratory hospitalisations. More extensive monitoring in urban centres is required to further elucidate the associations.},

We measured 2 × 24-h integrated personal exposure to PM2.5 and black carbon in two seasons in 402 participants living in peri-urban South India. Means (sd) of PM2.5 personal exposure were 55.1(82.8) µg/m3 for men and 58.5(58.8) µg/m3 for women; corresponding figures for black carbon were 4.6(7.0) µg/m3 and 6.1(9.6) µg/m3. Most variability in personal exposure was within participant (intra-class correlation {\~{}}20{\%}). Personal exposure measurements were not correlated (Rspearman {\textless}0.2) with annual ambient concentration at residence modeled by land-use regression; no subgroup with moderate or good agreement could be identified (weighted kappa ≤ 0.3 in all subgroups). We developed models to predict personal exposure in men and women separately, based on time-invariant characteristics collected at baseline (individual, household, and general time-activity) using forward stepwise model building with mixed models. Models for women included cooking activities and household socio-economic position, while models for men included smoking and occupation. Models performed moderately in terms of between-participant variance explained (38–53{\%}) and correlations between predictions and measurements (Rspearman: 0.30–0.50). More detailed, time-varying time-activity data did not substantially improve the performance of the models. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting personal exposure in support of epidemiological studies investigating long-term particulate matter exposure in settings characterized by solid fuel use and high occupational exposure to particles.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of low-cost microsensors measuring various air pollutants has significant potential for carrying out high-resolution mapping of air quality in the urban environment. However, the data obtained by such sensors are generally less reliable than that from standard equipment and they are subject to significant data gaps in both space and time. In order to overcome this issue, we present here a data fusion method based on geostatistics that allows for merging observations of air quality from a network of low-cost sensors with spatial information from an urban-scale air quality model. The performance of the methodology is evaluated for nitrogen dioxide in Oslo, Norway, using both simulated datasets and real-world measurements from a low-cost sensor network for January 2016. The results indicate that the method is capable of producing realistic hourly concentration fields of urban nitrogen dioxide that inherit the spatial patterns from the model and adjust the prior values using the information from the sensor network. The accuracy of the data fusion method is dependent on various factors including the total number of observations, their spatial distribution, their uncertainty (both in terms of systematic biases and random errors), as well as the ability of the model to provide realistic spatial patterns of urban air pollution. A validation against official data from air quality monitoring stations equipped with reference instrumentation indicates that the data fusion method is capable of reproducing city-wide averaged official values with an R2 of 0.89 and a root mean squared error of 14.3 $\mu$g m−3. It is further capable of reproducing the typical daily cycles of nitrogen dioxide. Overall, the results indicate that the method provides a robust way of extracting useful information from uncertain sensor data using only a time-invariant model dataset and the knowledge contained within an entire sensor network.},

abstract = {This paper compares Models-3/Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) outputs at multiple resolutions by interpolating from coarse resolution to fine resolution and analyzing the interpolation difference. Spatial variograms provide a convenient way to investigate the spatial character of interpolation differences and, importantly, to distinguish between naive (nearest neighbor) interpolation and bilinear interpolation, which takes a weighted average of four neighboring cells. For example, when the higher resolution is three times the lower, the variogram of the difference between naive interpolation of the lower resolution output and the higher resolution output shows a depression at every third lag. This phenomenon is related to the blocky nature of naive interpolation and demonstrates the inferiority of naive interpolation to bilinear interpolation in a way that pixelwise comparisons cannot. Theoretical investigations show when one can expect to observe this periodic depression in the variogram of interpolation differences. Naive interpolation is in fact used widely in a number of settings; our results suggest that it should be routinely replaced by bilinear interpolation.},

abstract = {This study presents a proof-of-concept agent-based model (ABM) of health vulnerability to long-term exposure to airborne particulate pollution, specifically to particles less than 10 micrometres in size (PM10), in Seoul, Korea. We estimated the differential effects of individual behaviour and social class across heterogeneous space in two districts, Gwanak and Gangnam. Three scenarios of seasonal PM10 change (business as usual: BAU, exponential increase: INC, and exponential decrease: DEC) and three scenarios of resilience were investigated, comparing the vulnerability rate both between and within each district. Our first result shows that the vulnerable groups in both districts, including those aged over 65, aged under 15, and with a low education level, increased sharply after 5,000 ticks (each tick corresponding to 1 day). This implies that disparities in health outcomes can be explained by socioeconomic status (SES), especially when the group is exposed over a long period. Additionally, while the overall risk population was larger in Gangnam in the AC100 scenarios, the recovery level from resilience scenarios decreased the risk population substantially, for example from 7.7{\%} to 0.7{\%}. Our second finding from the local-scale analysis indicates that most Gangnam sub-districts showed more variation both spatially and in different resilience scenarios, whereas Gwanak areas showed a uniform pattern regardless of earlier prevention. The implication for policy is that, while some areas, such as Gwanak, clearly require urgent mitigating action, areas like Gangnam may show a greater response to simpler corrections, but aggregating up to the district scale may miss particular areas that are more at risk. Future work should consider other pollutants as well as more sophisticated population and pollution modelling, coupled with explicit representation of transport and more careful treatment of individual doses and the associated health responses.},

abstract = {PM2.5 particles in air pollution have been widely considered associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have shown that PM2.5 can also cause central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation of microglia in the central nervous system can lead to inflammatory and neurological damage. PM2.5 will reduce the methylation level of DNA and affect epigenetics. PM2.5 enters the human body through a variety of pathways to have pathological effects on CNS. For example, PM2.5 can destroy the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so peripheral systemic inflammation easily crosses BBB and reaches CNS. The olfactory nerve is another way for PM2.5 particles to enter the brain. Surprisingly, PM2.5 can also enter the gastrointestinal tract, causing imbalances in the intestinal microecology to affect central nervous system diseases. The current work collected and discuss the mechanisms of PM2.5-induced CNS damage and PM2.5-induced neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {A comprehensive modelling approach has been developed to predict population exposure to the ambient air PM2.5 concentrations in different microenvironments in London. The modelling approach integrates air pollution dispersion and exposure assessment, including treatment of the locations and time activity of the population in three microenvironments, namely, residential, work and transport, based on national demographic information. The approach also includes differences between urban centre and suburban areas of London by taking account of the population movements and the infiltration of PM2.5 from outdoor to indoor. The approach is tested comprehensively by modelling ambient air concentrations of PM2.5 at street scale for the year 2008, including both regional and urban contributions. Model analysis of the exposure in the three microenvironments shows that most of the total exposure, 85{\%}, occurred at home and work microenvironments and 15{\%} in the transport microenvironment. However, the annual population weighted mean (PWM) concentrations of PM2.5 for London in transport microenvironments were almost twice as high (corresponding to 13–20 {\$}\mu{\$}g/m3) as those for home and work environments (7–12 {\$}\mu{\$}g/m3). Analysis has shown that the PWM PM2.5 concentrations in central London were almost 20{\%} higher than in the surrounding suburban areas. Moreover, the population exposure in the central London per unit area was almost three times higher than that in suburban regions. The exposure resulting from all activities, including outdoor to indoor infiltration, was about 20{\%} higher, when compared with the corresponding value obtained assuming inside home exposure for all times. The exposure assessment methodology used in this study predicted approximately over one quarter (−28{\%}) lower population exposure, compared with using simply outdoor concentrations at residential locations. An important implication of this study is that for estimating population exposure, one needs to consider the population movements, and the infiltration of pollution from outdoors to indoors.},

abstract = {Road transport is often the main source of air pollution in urban areas, and there is an increasing need to estimate its contribution precisely so that pollution-reduction measures (e.g. emission standards, scrapage programs, traffic management, ITS) are designed and implemented appropriately. This paper presents a meta-analysis of 50 studies dealing with the validation of various types of traffic emission model, including 'average speed', 'traffic situation', 'traffic variable', 'cycle variable', and 'modal' models. The validation studies employ measurements in tunnels, ambient concentration measurements, remote sensing, laboratory tests, and mass-balance techniques. One major finding of the analysis is that several models are only partially validated or not validated at all. The mean prediction errors are generally within a factor of 1.3 of the observed values for CO2, within a factor of 2 for HC and NOx, and within a factor of 3 for CO and PM, although differences as high as a factor of 5 have been reported. A positive mean prediction error for NOx (i.e. overestimation) was established for all model types and practically all validation techniques. In the case of HC, model predictions have been moving from underestimation to overestimation since the 1980s. The large prediction error for PM may be associated with different PM definitions between models and observations (e.g. size, measurement principle, exhaust/non-exhaust contribution).Statistical analyses show that the mean prediction error is generally not significantly different (p{\textless}0.05) when the data are categorised according to model type or validation technique. Thus, there is no conclusive evidence that demonstrates that more complex models systematically perform better in terms of prediction error than less complex models. In fact, less complex models appear to perform better for PM. Moreover, the choice of validation technique does not systematically affect the result, with the exception of a CO underprediction when the validation is based on ambient concentration measurements and inverse modelling. The analysis identified two vital elements currently lacking in traffic emissions modelling: 1) guidance on the allowable error margins for different applications/scales, and 2) estimates of prediction errors. It is recommended that current and future emission models incorporate the capability to quantify prediction errors, and that clear guidelines are developed internationally with respect to expected accuracy. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduction
Despite the London Underground (LU) handling on average 2.8 million passenger journeys per day, the characteristics and potential health effects of the elevated concentrations of metal-rich PM2.5 found in this subway system are not well understood.
Methods
Spatial monitoring campaigns were carried out to characterise the health-relevant chemical and physical properties of PM2.5 across the LU network, including diurnal and day-to-day variability and spatial distribution (above ground, depth below ground and subway line). Population-weighted station PM2.5 rankings were produced to understand the relative importance of concentrations at different stations and on different lines.
Results
The PM2.5 mass in the LU (mean 88 $\mu$g m−3, median 28 $\mu$g m−3) was greater than at ambient background locations (mean 19 $\mu$g m−3, median 14 $\mu$g m−3) and roadside environments in central London (mean 22 $\mu$g m−3, median 14 $\mu$g m−3). Concentrations varied between lines and locations, with the deepest and shallowest submerged lines being the District (median 4 $\mu$g m−3) and Victoria (median 361 $\mu$g m−3 but up to 885 $\mu$g m−3). Broadly in agreement with other subway systems around the world, sampled LU PM2.5 comprised 47{\%} iron oxide, 7{\%} elemental carbon, 11{\%} organic carbon, and 14{\%} metallic and mineral oxides. Although a relationship between line depth and air quality inside the tube trains was evident, there were clear influences relating to the distance from cleaner outside air and the exchange with cabin air when the doors open. The passenger population-weighted exposure analysis demonstrated a method to identify stations that should be prioritised for remediation to improve air quality.
Conclusion
PM2.5 concentrations in the LU are many times higher than in other London transport Environments. Failure to include this environment in epidemiological studies of the relationship between PM2.5 and health in London is therefore likely to lead to a large exposure misclassification error. Given the significant contribution of underground PM2.5 to daily exposure, and the differences in composition compared to urban PM2.5, there is a clear need for well-designed studies to better understand the health effects of underground exposure.},

abstract = {Interpolation methods can estimate individual-level exposures to air pollution from ambient monitors; however, few studies have evaluated how different approaches may affect health risk estimates. We applied multiple methods of estimating exposure for several air pollutants. We investigated how different methods of estimating exposure may influence health effect estimates in a case study of lung function data, forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC), for 2102 cohort subjects in Ulsan, Korea, for 2003–2007. Measurements from 13 monitors for particulate matter {\textless}10$\mu$m (PM10), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide were used to estimate individual-level exposures by averaging across values from all monitors, selecting the value from the nearest monitor, inverse distance weighting, and kriging. We assessed associations between pollutants and lung function in linear regression models, controlling for age, sex, and body mass index. Cross-validation indicated that kriging provided the most accurate estimated exposures. FVC was associated with all air pollutants under all methods of estimating exposure. Only ozone was associated with FEV1. An 11ppb increase in lag-0–2 8-h maximum ozone was associated with a 6.1{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 5.0, 7.3{\%}) decrease in FVC and a 0.50{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 0.03, 0.96{\%}) decrease in FEV1, based on kriged exposures. Central health effect estimates were generally higher using exposures based on averaging across all monitors or kriging. Results based on the nearest monitor approach had the lowest variance. Findings suggest that spatial interpolation methods may provide better estimates than monitoring values alone by reflecting the spatial variability of individual-level exposures and generating estimates for locations without monitors.},

To develop models that estimate pollutant concentrations at fine spatiotemporal scales and provide improved air pollution exposure assessments for health studies in Mexico City. We developed finer spatiotemporal land use regression (LUR) models for PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, CO and SO2 using mixed effect models with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Hourly traffic density was included as a temporal variable besides meteorological and holiday variables. Models of hourly, daily, monthly, 6-monthly and annual averages were developed and evaluated using traditional and novel indices. The developed spatiotemporal LUR models yielded predicted concentrations with good spatial and temporal agreements with measured pollutant levels except for the hourly PM2.5, PM10 and SO2. Most of the LUR models met performance goals based on the standardized indices. LUR models with temporal scales greater than one hour were successfully developed using mixed effect models with LASSO and showed superior model performance compared to earlier LUR models, especially for time scales of a day or longer. The newly developed LUR models will be further refined with ongoing Mexico City air pollution sampling campaigns to improve personal exposure assessments.},

abstract = {To characterize the relationships among the springtime NOx (NO + NO2), O3 and NO3 (defined as the combination of gaseous nitric acid, HNO3, and aerosol nitrate, NO3–) concentrations in the ambient air of the vicinity of highways, an intensive sampling was carried out in spring 2007 at Lyndhurst, NJ in the U.S. East Coast. Ambient concentrations of O3 and NOx were measured by O3 and NOx analyzers, while NO3 was collected using a ChemComb cartridge and determined by ion chromatography. Significant variations in O3 concentrations were observed diurnally as well as between weekdays and weekends, with higher concentrations occurring during the daytime and on weekends. The 24–h diurnal variations of O3 and NOx could be divided into four periods: (1) morning NOx peak, (2) mid–day O3 formation, (3) afternoon NOx accumulation and (4) nighttime balancing. Daily averaged relative humidity and wind speed were the two weather parameters affecting O3 levels more than other averaged parameters, and daily maximum temperature was positively correlated to the maximum O3. Via photochemical reactions and emission– diffusion balance, NOx showed primarily negative influences on the daily O3 variations with decayed exponential correlations, in particular during nighttime and weekdays, indicating a possible VOC–sensitive characteristic of the study area. A negative correlation between NO3– and O3 concentrations was found while no obvious influence of HNO3 on O3 was observed. Results by a multi–regression model involving three parameters (NO2/OX ratio, NO2 and HNO3) reveal that the NO2/OX ratio is an important parameter controlling the ground O3 level in the study area.},

The PM data analysis showed clear diurnal, weekly and seasonal cycles at the study site. In diurnal cycle, highest PM concentrations were observed during weekday's peak hour traffic and lowest PM concentrations were found during trickle traffic (afternoon and nighttime). The seasonal PM data analysis showed highest concentrations during post monsoon season (PM10 = 189, PM2.5 = 84, PM1 = 66$\mu$g/m3) compared to winter (PM10 = 135, PM2.5 = 73, PM1 = 59$\mu$g/m3) and summer (PM10 = 102, PM2.5 = 50, PM1 = 34$\mu$g/m3) seasons. The particle size distribution during post-monsoon, winter and summer seasons showed two distinct modes viz. accumulation (mean diameter, d = 2.2$\mu$m; distribution = 40{\%}) and coarse (d = 7.1$\mu$m, distribution = 60{\%}). The frequency distribution of PM10 concentrations during post–monsoon and winter seasons indicated that the PM10 values at the study site fall under moderate to poor categories. During post–monsoon and winter seasons, it was found that more than 50{\%} of the time the 24–h average PM10 concentrations were violating the Indian national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) (100$\mu$g/m3) and world health organization (WHO) standard (50$\mu$g/m3). The 24–h average PM2.5 concentrations were also exceeding the NAAQS (60$\mu$g/m3) and WHO standards (25$\mu$g/m3) by 75{\%} of time, irrespective of seasons.},

abstract = {Adverse health effects from exposure to air pollution are a global challenge and of widespread concern. Recent high ambient concentration episodes of air pollutants in European cities highlighted the dynamic nature of human exposure and the gaps in data and knowledge about exposure patterns. In order to support health impact assessment it is essential to develop a better understanding of individual exposure pathways in people's everyday lives by taking account of all environments in which people spend time. Here we describe the development, validation and results of an exposure method applied in a study conducted in Scotland.A low-cost particle counter based on light-scattering technology - the Dylos 1700 was used. Its performance was validated in comparison with equivalent instruments (TEOM-FDMS) at two national monitoring network sites (R2=0.9 at a rural background site, R2=0.7 at an urban background site). This validation also provided two functions to convert measured PNCs into calculated particle mass concentrations for direct comparison of concentrations with equivalent monitoring instruments and air quality limit values.This study also used contextual and time-based activity data to define six microenvironments (MEs) to assess everyday exposure of individuals to short-term PM2.5 concentrations. The Dylos was combined with a GPS receiver to track movement and exposure of individuals across the MEs. Seventeen volunteers collected 35 profiles. Profiles may have a different overall duration and structure with respect to times spent in different MEs and activities undertaken. Results indicate that due to the substantial variability across and between MEs, it is essential to measure near-complete exposure pathways to allow for a comprehensive assessment of the exposure risk a person encounters on a daily basis. Taking into account the information gained through personal exposure measurements, this work demonstrates the added value of data generated by the application of low-cost monitors.},

abstract = {Quantifying human exposure to air pollutants is a challenging task. Ambient concentrations of air pollutants at potentially harmful levels are ubiquitous in urban areas and subject to high spatial and temporal variability. At the same time, every individual has unique activity-patterns. Exposure results from multifaceted relationships and interactions between environmental and human systems, adding complexity to the assessment process. Traditionally, approaches to quantify human exposure have relied on pollutant concentrations from fixed air quality network sites and static population distributions. New developments in sensor technology now enable us to monitor personal exposure to air pollutants directly while people are moving through their activity spaces and varying concentration fields. The literature review on which this paper is based on reflects recent developments in the assessment of human exposure to air pollution. This includes the discussion of methodologies and concepts, and the elaboration of approaches and study designs applied in the field. We identify shortcomings of current approaches and discuss future research needs. We close by proposing a novel conceptual model for the integrated assessment of human exposure to air pollutants taking into account latest technological capabilities and contextual information. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We aimed to estimate the combined (interactive) mortality effects of PA and long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) among older adults in Hong Kong.Participants aged ≥65 years from the Elderly Health Service Cohort (n = 66 820) reported their habitual PA at baseline (1998–2001) and were followed up till 31 December 2011. We used a satellite-based spatiotemporal model to estimate PM2.5 concentration at the residential address for each participant. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to assess the interaction between habitual PA and long-term exposure to PM2.5 on cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. We tested for additive interaction by estimating relative excess risk due to interaction and multiplicative interaction employing P-value for the interaction term.The death risks were inversely associated with a higher volume of PA and were positively associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5. The benefits of PA were more pronounced for participation in traditional Chinese exercise (e.g. Tai Chi) and aerobic exercise (e.g. cycling). We found little evidence of interaction between PA (volume and type) and long-term exposure to PM2.5 on either additive or multiplicative scales.In this cohort of older Chinese adults, PA may decrease the risk of mortality, be it in areas of relatively good or bad air quality. The beneficial mortality effects of habitual PA outweighed the detrimental effects of long-term exposure to air pollution in Hong Kong.},

abstract = {Active travel (cycling, walking) is beneficial for the health due to increased physical activity (PA). However, active travel may increase the intake of air pollution, leading to negative health consequences. We examined the risk–benefit balance between active travel related PA and exposure to air pollution across a range of air pollution and PA scenarios. The health effects of active travel and air pollution were estimated through changes in all-cause mortality for different levels of active travel and air pollution. Air pollution exposure was estimated through changes in background concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ranging from 5 to 200$\mu$g/m3. For active travel exposure, we estimated cycling and walking from 0 up to 16h per day, respectively. These refer to long-term average levels of active travel and PM2.5 exposure. For the global average urban background PM2.5 concentration (22$\mu$g/m3) benefits of PA by far outweigh risks from air pollution even under the most extreme levels of active travel. In areas with PM2.5 concentrations of 100$\mu$g/m3, harms would exceed benefits after 1h 30min of cycling per day or more than 10h of walking per day. If the counterfactual was driving, rather than staying at home, the benefits of PA would exceed harms from air pollution up to 3h 30min of cycling per day. The results were sensitive to dose–response function (DRF) assumptions for PM2.5 and PA. PA benefits of active travel outweighed the harm caused by air pollution in all but the most extreme air pollution concentrations.},

abstract = {Existing methodologies of sensitivity analysis may be insufficient for a proper analysis of Agent-based Models (ABMs). Most ABMs consist of multiple levels, contain various nonlinear interactions, and display emergent behaviour. This limits the information content that follows from the classical sensitivity analysis methodologies that link model output to model input. In this paper we evaluate the performance of three well-known methodologies for sensitivity analysis. The three methodologies are  extended OAT (one-at-a-time), and proportional assigning of output variance by means of model fitting and by means of Sobol' decomposition. The methodologies are applied to a case study of limited complexity consisting of free-roaming and procreating agents that make harvest decisions with regard to a diffusing renewable resource. We find that each methodology has its own merits and exposes useful information, yet none of them provide a complete picture of model behaviour. We recommend extended OAT as the starting point for sensitivity analysis of an ABM, for its use in uncovering the mechanisms and patterns that the ABM produces.},

abstract = {Agent-based models are increasingly used to address questions regarding real-world phenomena and mechanisms; therefore, the calibration of model parameters to certain data sets and patterns is often needed. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is an important part of the development and analysis of any simulation model. By exploring the sensitivity of model output to changes in parameters, we learn about the relative importance of the various mechanisms represented in the model and how robust the model output is to parameter uncertainty. These insights foster the understanding of models and their use for theory development and applications. Both steps of the model development cycle require massive repetitions of simulation runs with varying parameter values. To facilitate parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis for agent-based modellers, we show how to use a suite of important established methods. Because NetLogo and R are widely used in agent-based modelling and for statistical analyses, we use a simple model implemented in NetLogo as an example, packages in R that implement the respective methods, and the RNetLogo package, which links R and NetLogo. We briefly introduce each method and provide references for further reading. We then list the packages in R that may be used for implementing the methods, provide short code examples demonstrating how the methods can be applied in R, and present and discuss the corresponding outputs. The Supplementary Material includes full, adaptable code samples for using the presented methods with R and NetLogo. Our overall aim is to make agent-based modellers aware of existing methods and tools for parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis and to provide accessible tools for using these methods. In this way, we hope to contribute to establishing an advanced culture of relating agent-based models to data and patterns observed in real systems and to foster rigorous and structured analyses of agent-based models.},

abstract = {The advantage of electric vehicles (EVs) in terms of NOx reduction is well established, but their effect on particulate matter (PM) is subject to intense debate. Despite having no tailpipe emissions, EVs still emit PM through non-exhaust sources. In addition, EVs tend to be heavier than conventional vehicles due to their batteries. This chapter reviews the current literature regarding PM emissions from battery EVs. This chapter includes studies that investigate the relationship between weight and non-exhaust emissions, compare the weight of EVs and conventional vehicles, and investigate the PM emissions of EVs and compare with those of conventional vehicles. It is found that results for PM estimates vary significantly, depending on the methodologies used. In particular, resuspension of road dust and secondary PM due to tailpipe aerosols requires more research to reach a consensus. Overall, it appears that EVs do not result in significant reductions of PM and therefore cannot be considered the single solution to urban air pollution.},

We also describe the main strengths and limitations of this approach for questions with public health relevance. Finally, we describe both methodologic and substantive future directions that we believe will enhance the value of agent-based modeling for public health. In particular, advances in model validation, comparisons with other causal modeling procedures, and the expansion of the models to consider comorbidity and joint influences more systematically will improve the utility of this approach to inform public health research, practice, and policy.},

abstract = {Several studies have investigated the health of children attending schools located near busy roads. In this study, we have measured personal exposure to traffic-related pollutants in children to validate exposure classification based on school location. Personal exposure to PM2.5, soot, NOx and NO2 was measured during four 48-h periods. The study involved 54 children attending four different schools, two of which were located within 100m of a major road (one ring road and one freeway) and the other two were located at a background location in the city of Utrecht, The Netherlands. Outdoor monitoring was conducted at all school sites, during the personal measurements. A questionnaire was administered on time activity patterns and indoor sources at home. The outdoor concentration of soot was 74{\%} higher at the freeway school compared to its matched background school. Personal exposure to soot was 30{\%} higher. For NOx the outdoor concentration was 52{\%} higher at the freeway school compared to its background school. The personal concentration of NOx was 37{\%} higher for children attending the freeway school. Differences were smaller and insignificant for PM2.5 and NO2. No elevated personal exposure to air pollutants was found for the children attending the school near the ring road. We conclude that the school's proximity to a freeway can be used as a valid estimate of exposure in epidemiological studies on the effects of the traffic-related air pollutants soot and NOx in children.},

abstract = {Generative mechanism-based models of social systems, such as those represented by agent-based simulations, require that intraagent equations (or rules) be specified. However there are often many different choices available for specifying these equations, which can still be interpreted as falling within a particular class of mechanisms. Whilst it is important for a generative model to reproduce historically observed dynamics, it is also important for the model to be theoretically enlightening. Genetic programs (our own included) often produce concatenations that are highly predictive but are complex and hard to interpret theoretically. Here, we develop a new method - based on multi-objective genetic programming - for automating the exploration of both objectives simultaneously. We demonstrate the method by evolving the equations for an existing agent-based simulation of alcohol use behaviors based on social norms theory, the initial model structure for which was developed by a team of human modelers. We discover a trade-off between empirical fit and theoretical interpretability that offers insight into the social norms processes that influence the change and stasis in alcohol use behaviors over time.},

abstract = {The contribution of the three traffic-related components exhaust, abrasion, and resuspension to kerbside and urban background PM10 and PM1 levels was quantified based on the analysis of individual particles by scanning electron microscopy. A total of 160 samples was collected on 38 days between February and September 2009 at a kerbside and an urban background station in the urban/industrial Ruhr area (Germany). Based on size, morphology, chemical composition and stability under electron bombardment, the 111,003 particles studied in detail were classified into the following 14 particle classes: traffic/exhaust, traffic/abrasion, traffic/resuspension, carbonaceous/organic, industry/metallurgy, industry/power plants, secondary particles, (aged) sea salt, silicates, Ca sulfates, carbonates, Fe oxides/hydroxides, biological particles, and other particles. The traffic/exhaust component consists predominantly of externally mixed soot particles and soot internally mixed with secondary particles. The traffic/abrasion component contains all particles with characteristic tracer elements (Fe, Cu, Ba, Sb, Zn) for brake and tire abrasion. The traffic/resuspension component is defined by the mixing state and comprises all internally mixed particles with a high proportion of silicates or Fe oxides/hydroxides which contain soot or abrasion particles as minor constituent. In addition, silicates and Fe oxides/hydroxides internally mixed with chlorine and sulphur containing particles were also assigned to the traffic/resuspension component. The total contribution of traffic to PM10 was found to be 27{\%} at the urban background station and 48{\%} at the kerbside station, the corresponding values for PM1 are 15{\%} and 39{\%}. These values lie within the range reported in previous literature. The relative share of the different traffic components for PM10 at the kerbside station was 27{\%} exhaust, 15{\%} abrasion, and 58{\%} resuspension (38{\%}, 8{\%}, 54{\%} for PM1). For the urban background, the following relative shares were obtained for PM10: 22{\%} exhaust, 22{\%} abrasion and 56{\%} resuspension (40{\%}, 27{\%}, 33{\%} for PM1). Compared to previous publications we have observed a significantly lower portion of exhaust particles and a significantly higher portion of resuspension particles. The high abundance of resuspension particles underlines their significance for the observed adverse health effects of traffic emissions and for mitigation measures.},

abstract = {Detailed knowledge on the effects of air pollutants on human health is a prerequisite for the development of effective policies to reduce the adverse impact of ambient air pollution. The second edition of WHO's Air quality guidelines (AQG) for Europe, formulated in 1996, summarizes systematically the effects of several air pollutants. These guidelines have been used extensively to establish regulatory frameworks for air quality assessment and management. To support the development of European Union policy on clean air for Europe (CAF{\'{E}}), this WHO Working Group (WG) was convened to review systematically the most recent scientific evidence on the adverse health effects of particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The review focused on studies that were published after the second edition of the WHO AQG was produced, and which have been influential in changing our views on health-related aspects of the substances under consideration. The WG adopted a recommendation to use fine particulate matter, (PM2.5), as the indicator for health effects induced by particulate pollution such as increased risk of mortality in Europe, to supplement the commonly used PM10 (which includes fine and coarse particles). It also acknowledged the evidence that ozone produces short-term effects on mortality and respiratory morbidity, even at the low ozone concentrations experienced in many cities in Europe. Based on these findings the WG recommended that WHO should update exposure-response relationships for the most severe health outcomes induced by particulate matter and ozone presented by AQGs. The WG also concluded that an update of the current WHO AQG for nitrogen dioxide, which is also an important precursor for the formation of ozone and particulate matter, was not warranted.},

abstract = {We recognized that many health outcomes are associated with air pollution, but in this project launched by the US EPA, the intent was to assess the role of exposure to ambient air pollutants as risk factors only for respiratory effects in children. The NHANES-III database is a valuable resource for assessing children's respiratory health and certain risk factors, but lacks monitoring data to estimate subjects' exposures to ambient air pollutants. Since the 1970s, EPA has regularly monitored levels of several ambient air pollutants across the country and these data may be used to estimate NHANES subject's exposure to ambient air pollutants. The first stage of the project eventually evolved into assessing different estimation methods before adopting the estimates to evaluate respiratory health. Specifically, this paper describes an effort using EPA's AIRS monitoring data to estimate ozone and PM10 levels at census block groups. We limited those block groups to counties visited by NHANES-III to make the project more manageable and apply four different interpolation methods to the monitoring data to derive air concentration levels. Then we examine method-specific differences in concentration levels and determine conditions under which different methods produce significantly different concentration values. We find that different interpolation methods do not produce dramatically different estimations in most parts of the US where monitor density was relatively low. However, in areas where monitor density was relatively high (i.e., California), we find substantial differences in exposure estimates across the interpolation methods. Our results offer some insights into terms of using the EPA monitoring data for the chosen spatial interpolation methods.},

abstract = {The adverse effects of traffic-related air pollution on children's respiratory health have been widely reported, but few studies have evaluated the impact of traffic-control policies designed to reduce urban air pollution. We assessed associations between traffic-related air pollutants and respiratory/allergic symptoms amongst 8–9 year-old schoolchildren living within the London Low Emission Zone (LEZ). Information on respiratory/allergic symptoms was obtained using a parent-completed questionnaire and linked to modelled annual air pollutant concentrations based on the residential address of each child, using a multivariable mixed effects logistic regression analysis. Exposure to traffic-related air pollutants was associated with current rhinitis: NOx (OR 1.01, 95{\%} CI 1.00–1.02), NO2 (1.03, 1.00–1.06), PM10 (1.16, 1.04–1.28) and PM2.5 (1.38, 1.08–1.78), all per $\mu$g/m3 of pollutant, but not with other respiratory/allergic symptoms. The LEZ did not reduce ambient air pollution levels, or affect the prevalence of respiratory/allergic symptoms over the period studied. These data confirm the previous association between traffic-related air pollutant exposures and symptoms of current rhinitis. Importantly, the London LEZ has not significantly improved air quality within the city, or the respiratory health of the resident population in its first three years of operation. This highlights the need for more robust measures to reduce traffic emissions.},

abstract = {Whether a community is in the path of a natural disaster, the target of an act of terror, or simply striving to meet the demands of increasingly dense urban populations, a community resilience paradigm can help communities and individuals not just to mitigate damage and heal, but to thrive. This article discusses experiences from recent, large-scale disasters to explore how community resilience might serve as a sustainable paradigm for organizing public health and medical preparedness, response, and recovery. By strengthening health systems, meeting the needs of vulnerable populations, and promoting organizational competence, social connectedness, and psychological health, community resilience encourages actions that build preparedness, promote strong day-to-day systems, and address the underlying social determinants of health. Thus, community resilience resonates with a wide array of stakeholders, particularly those whose work routinely addresses health, wellness, or societal well-being.},

abstract = {The impact of urban air pollution on the environments and human health has drawn increasing concerns from researchers, policymakers and citizens. To reduce the negative health impact, it is of great importance to measure the air pollution at high spatial resolution in a timely manner. Traditionally, air pollution is measured using dedicated instruments at fixed monitoring stations, which are placed sparsely in urban areas. With the development of low-cost micro-scale sensing technology in the last decade, portable sensing devices installed on mobile campaigns have been increasingly used for air pollution monitoring, especially for traffic-related pollution monitoring. In the past, some reviews have been done about air pollution exposure models using monitoring data obtained from fixed stations, but no review about mobile sensing for air pollution has been undertaken. This article is a comprehensive review of the recent development in air pollution monitoring, including both the pollution data acquisition and the pollution assessment methods. Unlike the existing reviews on air pollution assessment, this paper not only introduces the models that researchers applied on the data collected from stationary stations, but also presents the efforts of applying these models on the mobile sensing data and discusses the future research of fusing the stationary and mobile sensing data.},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization and industrialization in developing countries have caused an increase in air pollutant concentrations, and this has attracted public concern due to the resulting harmful effects to health. Here we present, through the spatial-temporal characteristics of six criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) in Sichuan, a human health risk assessment framework conducted to evaluate the health risk of different age groups caused by ambient air pollutants. Public health resilience was evaluated with respect to the risk resulting from ambient air pollutants, and a spatial inequality analysis between the risk caused by ambient air pollutants and hospital density in Sichuan was performed based on the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient. The results indicated that high concentrations of PM2.5 (47.7 µg m−3) and PM10 (75.9 µg m−3) were observed in the Sichuan Basin; these two air pollutants posed a high risk to infants. The high risk caused by PM2.5 was mainly distributed in Sichuan Basin (1.14) and that caused by PM10 was principally distributed in Zigong (1.01). Additionally, the infants in Aba and Ganzi had high health resilience to the risk caused by PM2.5 (3.89 and 4.79, respectively) and PM10 (3.28 and 2.77, respectively), which was explained by the low risk in these two regions. These regions and Sichuan had severe spatial inequality between the infant hazard quotient caused by PM2.5 (G = 0.518, G = 0.493, and G = 0.456, respectively) and hospital density. This spatial inequality was also caused by PM10 (G = 0.525, G = 0.526, and G = 0.466, respectively), which is mainly attributed to the imbalance between hospital distribution and risk caused by PM2.5 (PM10) in these two areas. Such research could provide a basis for the formulation of medical construction and future air pollution control measures in Sichuan.},

abstract = {Air pollution imposes significant environmental and health risks worldwide and is expected to deteriorate in the coming decade as cities expand. Measuring population exposure to air pollution is crucial to quantifying risks to public health. In this work, we introduce a big data analytics framework to model residents' stay and commuters' travel exposure to outdoor PM 2.5 and evaluate their environmental justice, with Beijing as an example. Using mobile phone and census data, we first infer travel demand of the population to derive residents' stay activities in each analysis zone, and then focus on commuters and estimate their travel routes with a traffic assignment model. Based on air quality observations from monitoring stations and a spatial interpolation model, we estimate the outdoor PM 2.5 concentrations at a 500-m grid level and map them to road networks. We then estimate the travel exposure for each road segment by multiplying the PM 2.5 concentration and travel time spent on the road. By combining the estimated PM 2.5 exposure and housing price harnessed from online housing transaction platforms, we discover that in the winter, Beijing commuters with low wealth level are exposed to 13{\%} more PM 2.5 per hour than those with high wealth level when staying at home, but exposed to less PM 2.5 by 5{\%} when commuting the same distance (due to lighter traffic congestion in suburban areas). We also find that the residents from the southern suburbs of Beijing have both lower level of wealth and higher stay- and travel- exposure to PM 2.5 , especially in the winter. These findings inform more equitable environmental mitigation policies for future sustainable development in Beijing. Finally, or the first time in the literature, we compare the results of exposure estimated from passive data with subjective measures of perceived air quality (PAQ) from a survey. The PAQ data was collected via a mobile-app. The comparison confirms consistencies in results and the advantages of the big data for air pollution exposure assessments.},

The results obtained on regional roads showed that heavy-duty vehicles in traffic seem to have a major impact on on-road air quality. Measurements on highways that included a 10km tunnel and a 2km uphill section of road indicated that sub-50nm particles have different features from the other species because of their higher volatility. The other species showed quite high on-road concentrations in the tunnel. In-vehicle conditions were made similar to the on-road ones by setting the air conditioning (AC) mode to the fresh air mode. The in-vehicle NO2 concentration in the tunnel was over 0.50ppmV, which is almost five times higher than the 1-hour ambient air quality standard proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In sections other than the tunnel, the in-vehicle NO2 concentration was almost the same as the 1-hour WHO standard. Higher on-road NO2/NOx ratios than those of exhaust gases and different behavior of sub-50nm particles from other species suggested that NO2 and sub-50nm particles were mainly due to secondary products formed by atmospheric reactions.},

abstract = {Several approaches have been used to assess potential human exposure to environmental stresses and achieve optimal results under various conditions, such as for example, for different scales, groups of people, or points in time. A thorough literature review in this paper identifies the research gap regarding modeling approaches for assessing human exposure to environment stressors, and it indicates that microsimulation tools are becoming increasingly important in human exposure assessments of urban environments, in which each person is simulated individually and continuously. The paper further describes an agent-based model (ABM) framework that can dynamically simulate human exposure levels, along with their daily activities, in urban areas that are characterized by environmental stresses such as air pollution and heat stress. Within the framework, decision-making processes can be included for each individual based on rule-based behavior in order to achieve goals under changing environmental conditions. The ideas described in this paper are implemented in a free and open source NetLogo platform. A basic modeling scenario of the ABM framework in Hamburg, Germany, demonstrates its utility in various urban environments and individual activity patterns, as well as its portability to other models, programs, and frameworks. The prototype model can potentially be extended to support environmental incidence management through exploring the daily routines of different groups of citizens, and comparing the effectiveness of different strategies. Further research is needed to fully develop an operational version of the model.},

abstract = {Traditional urban and transport infrastructure planning that emphasized motorized transport has fractured public space systems and worsened environmental quality, leading to a decrease in active travel. A novel multiscale simulation method for supporting an integrated transportation infrastructure and public space design is presented in this paper. This method couples a mesoscale agent-based traffic prediction model, traffic-related emission calculation, microclimate simulations, and human thermal comfort assessment. In addition, the effects of five urban design strategies on traffic pollution and pedestrian level microclimate are evaluated (i.e., a “two-fold” evaluation). A case study in Beijing, China, is presented utilizing the proposed urban modeling-design framework to support the assessment of a series of transport infrastructure and public space scenarios, including the Baseline scenario, a System-Internal Integration scenario, and two External Integration scenarios. The results indicate that the most effective way of achieving an environmentally- and pedestrian- friendly urban design is to concentrate on both the integration of transport infrastructure and public space to mitigate system externalities (e.g., air pollution and heat exhaustion). It also demonstrates that the integrated blue-green approach is a promising way of improving local air quality, micro-climatic conditions, and human comfort.},

abstract = {This paper examines the utility of The Air Pollution Model (TAPM; version 2) in simulating meteorology and dispersion of PM10 for 1999 over the coastal city of Christchurch, New Zealand. Christchurch usually experiences severe degradation in air quality during austral winter. The formation of a nocturnal inversion layer and the emissions of particulate matter (PM10) mainly from solid fuel home heating appliances lead to severe smog episodes on an average of 30 nights during winter. The complex local topography surrounding the city in combination with influences from the urban areas can produce complicated boundary layer winds during quiescent weather. Simulated PM10 data are used for construction of annual exposure maps for the urban areas in order to assess the health impact of air pollutants due to chronic exposure (presented in an accompanying paper). Meteorology and PM10 dispersion results are statistically compared with the only permanent air pollution monitoring station available in order to evaluate the model's performance. Statistical measures such as the Index of Agreement (IOA) between modelled and measured data indicate that the model performs well. IOA is greater than 0.6 for meteorological variables, and various calculated skill scores place confidence in the model's performance. However, TAPM has a tendency to overestimate surface wind speed over urban areas during stagnant nocturnal conditions, resulting in quick flushing of pollutants.},

abstract = {Traffic congestion increases vehicle emissions and degrades ambient air quality, and recent studies have shown excess morbidity and mortality for drivers, commuters and individuals living near major roadways. Presently, our understanding of the air pollution impacts from congestion on roads is very limited. This study demonstrates an approach to characterize risks of traffic for on- and near-road populations. Simulation modeling was used to estimate on- and near-road NO2 concentrations and health risks for freeway and arterial scenarios attributable to traffic for different traffic volumes during rush hour periods. The modeling used emission factors from two different models (Comprehensive Modal Emissions Model and Motor Vehicle Emissions Factor Model version 6.2), an empirical traffic speed-volume relationship, the California Line Source Dispersion Model, an empirical NO2-NOx relationship, estimated travel time changes during congestion, and concentration-response relationships from the literature, which give emergency doctor visits, hospital admissions and mortality attributed to NO2 exposure. An incremental analysis, which expresses the change in health risks for small increases in traffic volume, showed non-linear effects. For a freeway, "U" shaped trends of incremental risks were predicted for on-road populations, and incremental risks are flat at low traffic volumes for near-road populations. For an arterial road, incremental risks increased sharply for both on- and near-road populations as traffic increased. These patterns result from changes in emission factors, the NO2-NOx relationship, the travel delay for the on-road population, and the extended duration of rush hour for the near-road population. This study suggests that health risks from congestion are potentially significant, and that additional traffic can significantly increase risks, depending on the type of road and other factors. Further, evaluations of risk associated with congestion must consider travel time, the duration of rush-hour, congestion-specific emission estimates, and uncertainties. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Our analysis shows there is a very large potential for reducing emissions and exposure if all car drivers living within a distance corresponding to a maximum of a 30 min bicycle ride to work would change to commuting by bicycle. It would result in {\textgreater} 111,000 new cyclists, corresponding to an increase of 209{\%} compared to the current situation. Mean population exposure would be reduced by about 7{\%} for both NOx and black carbon (BC) in the most densely populated area of the inner city of Stockholm. Applying a relative risk for NOx of 8{\%} decrease in all-cause mortality associated with a 10 ??g m??? 3 decrease in NOx, this corresponds to {\textgreater} 449 (95{\%} CI: 340???558) years of life saved annually for the Stockholm county area with 2.1 million inhabitants. This is more than double the effect of the reduced mortality estimated for the introduction of congestion charge in Stockholm in 2006.

The calculated exposure of BC and its corresponding impacts on mortality are likely underestimated. With this in mind the estimates using NOx, NO2 and BC show quite similar health impacts considering the 95{\%} confidence intervals.},

abstract = {There is an increasing interest in the unequal socio-spatial distribution of environmental ‘goods' and ‘bads' and the associated implications for geographical inequalities in health. Until recently, research in this area has focused on solitary environmental characteristics and has been hindered by the absence of geographically-specific measures that recognise the multifactorial nature of the physical environment. However, recent work in the United Kingdom has developed an area-level multivariate index of health-related physical environmental deprivation that captures both pathogenic and salutogenic environmental characteristics. Applications of this index have demonstrated that, at the national level, multiple environmental deprivation increased as the degree of income deprivation rose. Further, after adjusting for key confounders, there was a significant association between multiple environmental deprivation and the health outcomes of local residents. In the current study we tested the methods developed in the UK to create the New Zealand Multiple Environmental Deprivation Index (NZ-MEDIx) for small areas across the country (n = 1860). We considered whether socially disadvantaged places in New Zealand had higher levels of multiple environmental deprivation, and if environmental disadvantage exerted an influence on health after adjustment for key confounders such as socioeconomic status. We found that although neighbourhoods with higher levels of multiple environmental deprivation tended to have greater social disadvantage, this association was not linear. Further, multiple environmental deprivation tended to exert a modest effect on health that was independent of the age, sex and socioeconomic structure of the population. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to develop an index of multiple environmental deprivation in an alternative national context which has utility in epidemiological investigations.$\backslash$nHighlights$\backslash$n► We developed an approach for measuring health-related physical environmental deprivation. ► A neighbourhood index of multiple environmental deprivation was created for New Zealand. ► The index included measures of both pathogenic and salutogenic characteristics. ► Socially disadvantaged neighbourhoods had higher levels of multiple environmental deprivation. ► Multiple environmental deprivation was associated with health outcomes.},

abstract = {The concept of environmental justice (EJ) has recently gained currency, both as a factor for and a goal of sustainable development. Its implementation in practice implies establishing current environmental injustice patterns and analysing planning policies, with the aim to reduce socio-demographic inequalities in the negative environmental impact borne by different population groups. This paper proposes a method to assess differential exposure to excessive pollution levels by socio-demographic groups in intra-urban spaces.The approach developed in this paper is based upon GIS and quantitative spatial analysis techniques. It incorporates the idea of an 'environmental justice weighting scale' for policy-making, using normative pollution thresholds to measure inequalities more objectively and consistently. Spain's two largest cities, Madrid and Barcelona, have been chosen as case-studies, taking nitrogen dioxide as the pollutant, and the geographic distribution of six vulnerable population groups (children, elderly people and international immigrants) in the year 2010. The results reveal that a large part of these groups suffer exposure to air pollution exceeding the maximum permitted levels disproportionately, which would imply a case of environmental injustice.},

In Greater London we examined associations between traffic pollution and emergency hospital admissions for cardio-respiratory diseases by applying linear and piecewise linear Poisson regression models in a small-area analysis. For both models the results for children and adults were close to unity. In the elderly, linear models found negative associations whereas piecewise models found non-linear associations characterized by positive risks in the lowest and negative risks in the highest exposure category. An increased risk was observed among those living in areas with the highest socioeconomic deprivation. Estimates were not affected by adjustment for traffic noise. The lack of convincing positive linear associations between primary traffic pollution and hospital admissions agrees with a number of other reports, but may reflect residual confounding. The relatively greater vulnerability of the most deprived populations has important implications for public health.},

Our results show that China's significant efficiency gains fully offset emissions growth triggered by economic growth and other drivers. Capital formation is the largest final demand category in contributing annual PM2.5 emissions, but the associated emission level is steadily declining. Exports is the only final demand category that drives emission growth between 1997–2010. The production of exports led to emissions of 638 thousand tonnes of PM2.5, half of the EU27 annual total, and six times that of Germany. Embodied emissions in Chinese exports are largely driven by consumption in OECD countries},

abstract = {In a number of environmental-justice studies it has been noted that the exposure to an array of air pollutants varies between different social groups. This inequality in exposure is one possible explanation for the variations in pollution-related health outcomes such as lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. Previous environmental-justice studies that have focused upon air pollution have tended to be concerned with exposure to industrial and vehicle pollution and rely upon simple estimates of exposure, ignoring the complex interaction of emissions, topography, and meteorology that determine pollution levels in many urban areas. In this paper we use accurate and geographically detailed estimates of pollution calculated from an atmospheric dispersion model to examine issues of environmental justice related to air pollution sourced from domestic heating in Christchurch, New Zealand, a city with particularly high levels of particulate pollution during winter months. We consider whether there is a social gradient in exposure to air pollution in Christchurch by comparing estimates of particulate pollution for small areas across the city to a range of demographic and socioeconomic indicators including age, ethnicity, income, and deprivation. Furthermore, we examine whether there is a social gradient in exposure to extreme pollution episodes. We demonstrate that different social groups in the Christchurch population are exposed to different levels of both ambient air pollution and extreme air-pollution episodes. In particular, pollution is significantly higher among more disadvantaged communities. We also find evidence which suggests that the groups responsible for producing a large proportion of the pollution in Christchurch are not the same groups exposed to high levels of particulate air pollution.},

abstract = {Vehicle traffic is one of the most significant emission sources of air pollutants in urban areas. While the influence of mobile source emissions is felt throughout an urban area, concentrations from mobile emissions can be highest near major roadways. At present, information regarding the spatial and temporal patterns and the share of pollution attributable to traffic-related air pollutants is limited, in part due to concentrations that fall sharply with distance from roadways, as well as the few monitoring sites available in cities. This study uses a newly developed dispersion model (RLINE) and a spatially and temporally resolved emissions inventory to predict hourly PM2.5 and NOx concentrations across Detroit (MI, USA) at very high spatial resolution. Results for annual averages and high pollution days show contrasting patterns, the need for spatially resolved analyses, and the limitations of surrogate metrics like proximity or distance to roads. Data requirements, computational and modeling issues are discussed. High resolution pollutant data enable the identification of pollutant "hotspots", "project-level" analyses of transportation options, development of exposure measures for epidemiology studies, delineation of vulnerable and susceptible populations, policy analyses examining risks and benefits of mitigation options, and the development of sustainability indicators integrating environmental, social, economic and health information.},

We consider the recent history of the environmental justice debate in Britain, Europe, and the USA and, in the light of this, estimate how one aspect of air pollution, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, affects different population groups differentially across Britain. We also estimate the extent to which people living in each community in Britain contribute towards this pollution, with the aid of information on the characteristics of the vehicles they own. We find that, although community NOx, emission and ambient NO2 concentration are strongly related, the communities that have access to fewest cars tend to suffer from the highest levels of air pollution, whereas those in which car ownership is greatest enjoy the cleanest air. Pollution is most concentrated in areas where young children and their parents are more likely to live and least concentrated in areas to which the elderly tend to migrate. Those communities that are most polluted and which also emit the least pollution tend to be amongst the poorest in Britain. There is therefore evidence of environmental injustice in the distribution and production of poor air quality in Britain. However, the spatial distribution of those who produce and receive most of that pollution have to be considered simultaneously to see this injustice clearly.},

abstract = {Ambient monitors are commonly used to estimate exposure for epidemiological studies, and air quality modeling is infrequently applied. However air quality modeling systems have the potential to alleviate some, although not all, of the limitations of monitoring networks. To investigate this application, exposure estimates were generated for a case study high ozone episode in the Northern Georgia Region of the United States based on measurements and concentration estimates from an air quality modeling system. Hourly estimates for 2268 4-km by 4-km gridcells were generated in a domain that includes only eight ozone monitors. Individual and population-based ozone exposures were estimated using multiple approaches, including area-weighted average of modeled estimates, nearest monitor, and spatial interpolation by inverse distance weighting and kriging. Results based on concentration fields from the air quality modeling system revealed spatial heterogeneity that was obscured by approaches based on the monitoring network. With some techniques, such as spatial interpolation, monitoring data alone was insufficient to estimate exposure for certain areas, especially for rural populations. For locations far from ozone monitors, the estimates from the nearest monitor approach tended to overestimate exposure, compared to modeled estimates. Counties in which one or more monitors were present had statistically higher population density and modeled ozone estimates than did counties without monitors (p-value {\textless} 0.05). This work demonstrates the use of air quality modeling to generate higher spatial and temporal resolution exposure estimates, and compares the advantages of this approach to traditional methods that use monitoring data alone.

abstract = {Ground-level ozone (O(3)) and fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) are associated with increased risk of mortality. We quantify the burden of modeled 2005 concentrations of O(3) and PM(2.5) on health in the United States. We use the photochemical Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model in conjunction with ambient monitored data to create fused surfaces of summer season average 8-hour ozone and annual mean PM(2.5) levels at a 12 km grid resolution across the continental United States. Employing spatially resolved demographic and concentration data, we assess the spatial and age distribution of air-pollution-related mortality and morbidity. For both PM(2.5) and O(3) we also estimate: the percentage of total deaths due to each pollutant; the reduction in life years and life expectancy; and the deaths avoided according to hypothetical air quality improvements. Using PM(2.5) and O(3) mortality risk coefficients drawn from the long-term American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort study and National Mortality and Morbidity Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS), respectively, we estimate 130,000 PM(2.5) -related deaths and 4,700 ozone-related deaths to result from 2005 air quality levels. Among populations aged 65-99, we estimate nearly 1.1 million life years lost from PM(2.5) exposure and approximately 36,000 life years lost from ozone exposure. Among the 10 most populous counties, the percentage of deaths attributable to PM(2.5) and ozone ranges from 3.5{\%} in San Jose to 10{\%} in Los Angeles. These results show that despite significant improvements in air quality in recent decades, recent levels of PM(2.5) and ozone still pose a nontrivial risk to public health.},

Humans play a critical role in affecting such systems and in giving rise to various environmental consequences, which may in turn affect future human decisions and behavior. In light of complexity theory and its application in CHANS, this paper reviews various decision models used in agent based simulations of CHANS dynamics, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. This paper concludes by advocating development of more process-based decision models as well as protocols or architectures that facilitate better modeling of human decisions in various CHANS.},

abstract = {Understanding and modelling route choice behaviour is central to predicting the formation and propagation of urban road congestion. Yet within conventional literature disagreements persist around the nature of route choice behaviour, and how it should be modelled. In this paper, both the shortest path and anchor-based perspectives on route choice behaviour are explored through an empirical analysis of nearly 700,000 minicab routes across London, United Kingdom. In the first set of analyses, the degree of similarity between observed routes and possible shortest paths is established. Shortest paths demonstrate poor performance in predicting both observed route choice and characteristics. The second stage of analysis explores the influence of specific urban features, named anchors, in route choice. These analyses show that certain features attract more route choices than would be expected were individuals choosing route based on cost minimisation alone. Instead, the results indicate that major urban features form the basis of route choice planning – being selected disproportionately more often, and causing asymmetry in route choice volumes by direction of travel. At a finer scale, decisions made at minor road features are furthermore demonstrated to influence routing patterns. The results indicate a need to revisit the basis of how routes are modelled, shifting from the shortest path perspective to a mechanism structured around urban features. In concluding, the main trends are synthesised within an initial framework for route choice modelling, and presents potential extensions of this research.},

abstract = {Urban systems are highly complex and non-linear in nature, defined by the behaviours and interactions of many individuals. Building on a wealth of new data and advanced simulation methods, conventional research into urban systems seeks to embrace this complexity, measuring and modelling cities with increasingly greater detail and reliability. The practice of transportation modelling, despite recent developments, lags behind these advances. This paper addresses the implications resulting from variations in model design, with a focus on the behaviour and cognition of drivers, demonstrating how different models of choice and experience significantly influence the distribution of traffic. It is demonstrated how conventional models of urban traffic have not fully incorporated many of the important findings from the cognitive science domain, instead often describing actions in terms of individual optimisation. We introduce exploratory agent-based modelling that incorporates representations of behaviour from a more cognitively rich perspective. Specifically, through these simulations, we identify how spatial cognition in respect to route selection and the inclusion of heterogeneity in spatial knowledge significantly impact the spatial extent and volume of traffic flow within a real-world setting. These initial results indicate that individual-level models of spatial cognition can potentially play an important role in predicting urban traffic flow, and that greater heed should be paid to these approaches going forward. The findings from this work hold important lessons in the development of models of transport systems and hold potential implications for policy.},

abstract = {The UK atmospheric dispersion modelling system is a computer code for modelling the dispersion of buoyant or neutrally buoyant gaseous and particulate emissions to the atmosphere. It comprises a number of individual modules, each dealing with either one aspect of the dispersion process or data input and output. Each module can be modified independently to keep it, and hence the whole model, scientifically up-to-date. Emissions can be of any duration. The effects of plume rise, wet and dry deposition, radio-active decay, hilly and variable roughness terrain, coastal regions and large buildings are allowed for. Fluctuations in concentration about the calculated mean are also modelled for time scales less than one hour. Output includes mean values, variances and percentiles of air concentration, dosage (time integrated concentration raised to some power), and deposition to the ground. For emissions of radio-active isotopes estimates can be made of the ground level gamma-radiation dose rate beneath the plume. A user interacts with the model via a system of menus based on Microsoft Windows so that it is easy to use. ?? 1994.},
