As a further demonstration of modelling accurate pollution fields and individualâ€™s mobility, this chapter examined the process of trips and their cumulative exposure to PM. Seoul CBD (Central Business District) was chosen for a case study as this area is one of the most crowded areas of Seoul during day hours with many office workers, tourists, taxi and bus drivers, and passenger cars. Further, the government of Seoul has chosen the CBD to follow the new Clean Air Zone (CAZ) act. 4.1 Data list 4.1.1 Air Pollution Hourly measured PM10 and NO2 was used from two urban background stations (Jongno, Jung) and two roadside stations (Jongno4, Cheonggyecheon). Considering the high concentrations of air pollution in winter, the study period was set in January 1st-December 31st, 2018. Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualisation were done under the tidyverse package in R 3.6.0. 4.2 What the data looks like: Exploration with R 4.3 Output: Univeral Kriging 4.4 Output: Generalised Additive Models 4.5 Summary "]
